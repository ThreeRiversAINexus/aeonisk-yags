    reasoning: "As the crisis at the ACG Futures Market deepens, I know we need to\
      \ act quickly and decisively. While my teammates have made some progress, the\
      \ situation requires a more targeted approach. Drawing on my family's Breath\

      \ My team needs this edge if we're going to stop the Soulcredit markets from\

      wildly, the entire Aeonic economy teeters on the brink of collapse. Only a team
