# Integration Complete: Mechanical Resolution System

## ‚úÖ All Components Integrated

The mechanical resolution system has been fully integrated into the multi-agent gameplay system.

### What Was Integrated

#### 1. **DM Agent** (`dm.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Clock Creation**: DM creates scenario-specific clocks during scenario generation
  - Bond Crisis: Sanctuary Corruption, Saboteur Exposure, Communal Stability
  - Corporate Intrigue: Corporate Suspicion, Evidence Trail, Facility Lockdown
  - Void Investigation: Reality Collapse, Void Contamination, Investigation Progress
- ‚úÖ **Mechanical Resolution**: All player actions resolved with Attribute √ó Skill + d20
- ‚úÖ **Ritual Enforcement**: Checks for tools/offerings and applies void penalties
- ‚úÖ **Clock Updates**: Automatically advances/regresses clocks based on outcomes
- ‚úÖ **Void Triggers**: Detects void exposure and updates character corruption
- ‚úÖ **Clock Triggers**: Announces when clocks fill with scenario-appropriate beats
- ‚úÖ **LLM Integration**: Passes resolution outcomes to LLM for narrative generation

#### 2. **Player Agent** (`player.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Prompts**: Uses mechanical scaffolding with character stats and recent intents
- ‚úÖ **Action Schema**: Generates ActionDeclarations with full mechanical details
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Checks for duplicate intents and suggests alternatives
- ‚úÖ **LLM Structured Output**: Prompts LLM to provide formatted action declarations
- ‚úÖ **Fallback System**: Simple action generation when LLM unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Void Tracking**: Updates character void score from mechanics engine
- ‚úÖ **De-duplication**: Prevents action spam by varying approaches

#### 3. **Session** (`session.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Initialization**: Mechanics systems initialize on session creation
- ‚úÖ **Final State Report**: Prints clock states, void levels at session end
- ‚úÖ **State Persistence**: Saves full mechanics state in session output

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd /home/p/Coding/aeonisk-yags
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install ChromaDB for semantic search
pip install chromadb

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# or add to scripts/aeonisk/.env
```

### Run a Test Session

```bash
cd scripts
python3 run_multiagent_session.py session_config.json
```

### Expected Output

You should see:

1. **Initialization**:
```
Initializing mechanics systems...
‚úì Mechanics engine ready
‚úì Action validator ready
‚úì Knowledge retrieval ready
```

2. **Scenario Generation**:
```
[DM dm_01] Generated scenario: Bond Crisis
Location: Resonance Commune Sanctuary, Nimbus
Situation: Sacred bonding ritual sabotaged...
[DM dm_01] Created clock: Sanctuary Corruption (0/6)
[DM dm_01] Created clock: Saboteur Exposure (0/6)
[DM dm_01] Created clock: Communal Stability (0/6)
```

3. **Player Actions** (with mechanical details):
```
[Zara Nightwhisper] Zara Nightwhisper: Scan disrupted resonance field (Perception √ó Tech/Craft vs ~25)
```

4. **DM Resolutions** (with dice rolls):
```
[DM dm_01] ===== Resolution =====
**Scan disrupted resonance field**
Roll: (Perception √ó Tech/Craft) + d20
Result: 4 √ó 4 + 14 = **30** vs DC 25
Margin: +5
Outcome: **MODERATE** ‚úì
Scan disrupted resonance field succeeds adequately (margin: +5)

You detect a Tempest-grade disruptor signature, crudely masked with Commune frequencies. The technical analysis reveals hexagonal grid patterns consistent with corporate sabotage.
========================================
```

5. **Void Changes**:
```
[Echo Resonance] Void: 0 ‚Üí 1 (Ritual: Harmonize group bonds)
```

6. **Clock Triggers**:
```
üö® **Saboteur Exposure FILLED!** You've identified the perpetrator - they make a desperate move!
```

7. **Final Summary**:
```
=== Session test_session Ending ===

--- Final State Summary ---

Scene Clocks:
  Sanctuary Corruption: 2/6
  Saboteur Exposure: 6/6 [FILLED]
  Communal Stability: 4/6

Void States:
  player_01: 2/10 (Touched)
  player_02: 1/10 (Touched)
========================================
```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Mechanics initialize without errors
- [ ] Scenario-specific clocks are created
- [ ] Player actions include attribute, skill, difficulty
- [ ] DM resolutions show dice rolls and outcomes
- [ ] Void scores change when appropriate
- [ ] Scene clocks advance based on outcomes
- [ ] Duplicate actions are rejected with suggestions
- [ ] Clock triggers fire when filled
- [ ] Final summary shows all state

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Ritual with Missing Components

Configure a player to attempt a ritual without tools:
- Player should get +1 Void penalty
- Resolution should note "No primary tool: +1 Void risk"

#### Test 2: Action Repetition

Have a player try the same action twice:
- Second attempt should be rejected
- Should suggest 3 alternative actions

#### Test 3: Clock Progression

Track a specific clock:
- Failed actions should advance threat clocks
- Successful investigations should advance progress clocks
- When filled, should trigger scenario beat

#### Test 4: Void Accumulation

Monitor void scores across multiple actions:
- Ritual failures should add void
- Void exposure should add void
- Bond betrayal should add more void

## üìä Output Files

After running, check:

```bash
ls multiagent_output/
# session_[id].json - Full session data with mechanics
# session_[id].yaml - Human-readable format

cat multiagent_output/session_*.yaml | grep -A 20 "mechanics:"
# Should show: scene_clocks, void_states, recent_actions
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found: mechanics"

The module is in `scripts/aeonisk/multiagent/`. Run from `scripts/` directory:
```bash
cd /home/p/Coding/aeonisk-yags/scripts
python3 run_multiagent_session.py session_config.json
```

### "No dice rolls appearing"

Check that actions include mechanical details:
- `attribute`: Must be valid attribute name
- `skill`: Can be None
- `difficulty_estimate`: Must be integer 5-50
- `attribute_value`, `skill_value`: Must be provided

### "ChromaDB errors"

ChromaDB is optional. If you see errors:
```bash
pip uninstall chromadb  # System will use fallback keyword search
```

### "Actions keep repeating"

Check validator is active:
```python
# In player.py _ai_player_turn
validator = self.shared_state.get_action_validator()  # Should not be None
```

### "Clocks not advancing"

Check DM is calling:
```python
mechanics.update_clocks_from_action(resolution, action)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Adjusting Difficulty

In `dm.py`, the DM uses `mechanics.get_difficulty_recommendation()` which can be tuned.

### Customizing Clocks

Add new clock patterns in `dm.py` SCENARIO_SEEDS:
```python
'clocks': [
    ('Your Clock Name', 6, 'Description'),
    # ...
]
```

### Tuning Void Triggers

In `mechanics.py`, edit `check_void_trigger()` to add/remove triggers.

### Changing De-duplication Window

In `action_schema.py`:
```python
IntentDeduplicator(window_size=3)  # Default is 3, increase to track more history
```

## üìà Performance Notes

- **Without LLM**: System uses simple action generation, very fast
- **With LLM**: Actions and resolutions use API calls, ~2-3 seconds per turn
- **ChromaDB**: First run indexes content (~5-10 seconds), subsequent runs instant
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Fallback keyword search works fine without ChromaDB

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Run test session to verify all integrations
2. Review output for dice rolls, void changes, clock progression
3. Test duplicate action rejection
4. Verify clock triggers fire correctly

### Short-term

1. Add more scenario templates with different clock configurations
2. Expand void trigger patterns for more actions
3. Create ritual component database for validation
4. Tune difficulty recommendations based on outcomes

### Long-term

1. Implement tactical combat with initiative order
2. Add bond mechanics integration
3. Create ritual effect templates
4. Build scenario generator that creates custom clocks
