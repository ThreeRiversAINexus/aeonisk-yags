What are the requirements?`\n- `LOOKUP: What is ACG and what do they do?`\n- `LOOKUP: What are the rules for void corruption?`\n\nThis is an **out-of-character** request for clarification, not an in-game action.

    "action_declaration_format": "# How to Declare Actions\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL: EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED** ⚠️\n\nYou MUST use this EXACT format for every action. Copy this template and fill in the values:\n\n```\nINTENT: [brief action - different from recent actions!]\nATTRIBUTE: [EXACT attribute name from character sheet]\nSKILL: [EXACT skill name from character sheet, or \"None\" for raw attribute]\nDIFFICULTY: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35+]\nJUSTIFICATION: [why that difficulty?]\nACTION_TYPE: [explore|investigate|ritual|social|combat|technical]\nDESCRIPTION: [1-2 sentence narrative]\n```\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\nEvery action you declare trains an AI model. Inconsistent formats (\"social\" vs \"Social\", \"charm\" vs \"Charm\") corrupt the training data and make the model less reliable. ALWAYS use exact names from your character sheet.\n\n**VALID ATTRIBUTES (use EXACTLY as shown):**\n- Strength, Agility, Endurance, Perception, Intelligence, Empathy, Willpower, Charisma, Size\n\n**VALID SKILLS (use EXACTLY as shown):**\n- Combat, Melee, Brawl, Guns, Athletics, Stealth, Awareness, Charm, Guile\n- Astral Arts, Attunement, Tech/Craft, Systems, Magick Theory\n- Counsel, Healing, Pilot, Drone Operation\n- Corporate Influence, Debt Law, Intimacy Ritual\n- OR \"None\" for raw attribute checks\n\n**VALID DIFFICULTY VALUES:**\n- 10 (Easy - straightforward tasks)\n- 15 (Routine - requires basic competence)\n- 20 (Moderate - standard challenge)\n- 25 (Challenging - requires skill and favorable conditions)\n- 30 (Difficult - expert-level task)\n- 35+ (Very Difficult - exceptional circumstances needed)\n\n**VALID ACTION_TYPE VALUES:**\n- explore, investigate, ritual, social, combat, technical\n\n**EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMAT:**\n\n```\nINTENT: Search the ritual chamber for hidden void artifacts\nATTRIBUTE: Perception\nSKILL: Awareness\nDIFFICULTY: 20\nJUSTIFICATION: Moderate challenge - searching cluttered area for concealed items\nACTION_TYPE: investigate\nDESCRIPTION: I carefully examine the chamber's corners and alcoves, looking for anything radiating void energy or hidden behind debris.\n```\n\n```\nINTENT: Convince the guard to let us pass\nATTRIBUTE: Charisma\nSKILL: Charm\nDIFFICULTY: 25\nJUSTIFICATION: Challenging - guard is following orders, need to overcome protocol\nACTION_TYPE: social\nDESCRIPTION: I flash my corporate credentials and explain we're here on official business, using my most authoritative tone.\n```\n\n**COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**\n❌ WRONG: `SKILL: hacking` → ✅ CORRECT: `SKILL: Systems` or `SKILL: Tech/Craft`\n❌ WRONG: `ATTRIBUTE: intelligence` → ✅ CORRECT: `ATTRIBUTE: Intelligence`\n❌ WRONG: `DIFFICULTY: hard` → ✅ CORRECT: `DIFFICULTY: 25`\n❌ WRONG: `ACTION_TYPE: attack` → ✅ CORRECT: `ACTION_TYPE: combat`",

    "ritual_requirements": "**⚠️ WHEN TO USE RITUALS:**\n- When manipulating void energy, anomalies, or spiritual phenomena\n- When channeling or harmonizing with astral forces\n- When attempting to stabilize, contain, or seal void corruption\n- When using Astral Arts skill for active void manipulation (NOT just sensing/analyzing)\n- Analysis/study can often use Intelligence × Magick Theory instead (no offerings needed)\n\n**For Rituals** (Astral Arts), you MUST specify offerings:\n```\nRITUAL: yes\nPRIMARY_TOOL: [yes/no - do you have crystal_focus or tech_kit?]\nOFFERING: [yes/no - do you have blood_offering or incense?]\nCOMPONENTS: [what materials: \"blood offering\" or \"incense stick\"]\n```\n\n**⚠️ RITUAL REQUIREMENTS - CHECK YOUR INVENTORY:**\n- **Primary Tool**: crystal_focus OR tech_kit OR access to ritual altar\n- **Offering**: blood_offering OR incense (consumed on use!)\n- Without offerings, rituals have -10 penalty and +2 void risk\n\n- If you're LOW on offerings, consider purchasing more from vendors!\n- Blood offerings and incense are commonly sold by ritual merchants\n\n**CRITICAL**: Don't waste offerings on analysis! Use:\n- Intelligence × Magick Theory → to understand/study void phenomena (no cost)\n- Willpower × Astral Arts → to actively manipulate/channel void (requires offerings)\n- Perception × Attunement → to sense/detect void currents (no cost)",
