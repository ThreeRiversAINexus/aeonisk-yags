Defence token on Sable to mitigate their melee threat.\nSHARE_INTEL: Echo has grenade, recommend spreading out\n```\n\n**Grenade with Friendly Fire:**\n```\nDEFENCE_TOKEN: pc_sable_001\nMAJOR_ACTION: Throw_Grenade\nTARGET: Near-Enemy\nWEAPON: Grenade\nMINOR_ACTION: Shift\nTACTICAL_REASONING: Throwing grenade at Near-Enemy to hit Sable even though Grunt Squad 2 will take friendly fire - Sable is too dangerous to leave active.

My doctrine prefers Near range for optimal effectiveness. Moving from my current position to Near-PC to close distance.\nSHARE_INTEL: Advancing to engage at medium range\n```\n\n**Tactical Retreat:**\n```\nDEFENCE_TOKEN: None\nMAJOR_ACTION: Retreat\nTARGET: None\nWEAPON: None\nMINOR_ACTION: None\nTACTICAL_REASONING: Health critical ({health}%), below retreat threshold ({threshold}%). Falling back through maintenance corridor to regroup.\nSHARE_INTEL: Withdrawing, recommend focus fire on primary threat\n```\n\n**Fleeing (Morale Break):**\n```\nDEFENCE_TOKEN: None\nMAJOR_ACTION: FLEE\nTARGET: None\nWEAPON: None\nMINOR_ACTION: None\nTACTICAL_REASONING: Morale broken, attempting escape.
