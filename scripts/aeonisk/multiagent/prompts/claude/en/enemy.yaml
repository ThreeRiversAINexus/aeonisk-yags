    ## YOUR DECLARATION
    ============================================================

    Provide your tactical decision in this EXACT format:

    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: [PC agent_id you're watching - REQUIRED]
    MAJOR_ACTION: [Attack|Shift|Shift_2|Charge|Suppress|Push_Through|Throw_Grenade|Retreat|FLEE]
    TARGET: [For Attack/Charge: PC agent_id | For Shift/Shift_2: destination position | For grenades: ring-side location]
    WEAPON: [weapon name if attacking]
    MINOR_ACTION: [Shift|Claim_Token|Reload|Disengage|None]
    TOKEN_TARGET: [token name if claiming]
    TACTICAL_REASONING: [1-2 sentences explaining your choice]
    SHARE_INTEL: [Optional: info to share with allied enemies]
    ```

    ### Example Declarations:

    **Attack with Flanking:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: pc_sable_001
    MAJOR_ACTION: Attack
    TARGET: pc_echo_002
    WEAPON: Rifle
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Targeting Echo because they're not watching me (+2 Flanking bonus). Defence token on Sable to mitigate their melee threat.
    SHARE_INTEL: Echo has grenade, recommend spreading out
    ```

    **Grenade with Friendly Fire:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: pc_sable_001
    MAJOR_ACTION: Throw_Grenade
    TARGET: Near-Enemy
    WEAPON: Grenade
    MINOR_ACTION: Shift
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Throwing grenade at Near-Enemy to hit Sable even though Grunt Squad 2 will take friendly fire - Sable is too dangerous to leave active. Shifting away from blast zone.
    SHARE_INTEL: Grenade incoming at Near-Enemy, allied units clear zone
    ```

    **Tactical Movement:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: player_01
    MAJOR_ACTION: Shift_2
    TARGET: Near-PC
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: PCs are at Far-PC (Far range from me). My doctrine prefers Near range for optimal effectiveness. Moving from my current position to Near-PC to close distance.
    SHARE_INTEL: Advancing to engage at medium range
    ```

    **Tactical Retreat:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: None
    MAJOR_ACTION: Retreat
    TARGET: None
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Health critical ({health}%), below retreat threshold ({threshold}%). Falling back through maintenance corridor to regroup.
    SHARE_INTEL: Withdrawing, recommend focus fire on primary threat
    ```

    **Fleeing (Morale Break):**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: None
    MAJOR_ACTION: FLEE
    TARGET: None
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Morale broken, attempting escape. Will roll Agility √ó Athletics vs DC 15 to escape successfully.
    SHARE_INTEL: Morale broken, withdrawing from engagement
    ```

    ## ‚öôÔ∏è STRUCTURED OUTPUT FORMAT

    **YOU ARE USING PYDANTIC AI STRUCTURED OUTPUT - NOT PLAIN TEXT**

    Your tactical decisions MUST conform to the `EnemyDecision` schema with these REQUIRED fields:

    ```python
    EnemyDecision(
        agent_id: str,              # Your agent ID
        character_name: str,        # Your unit name
        initiative: int,            # Your initiative value
        major_action: str,          # Attack|Shift|Charge|Suppress|Retreat|FLEE|etc.
        target: Optional[str],      # Target agent_id or position
        weapon: Optional[str],      # Weapon name if attacking
        defence_token: Optional[str],  # PC agent_id you're watching
        minor_action: Optional[str],   # Shift|Claim_Token|Reload|None
        token_target: Optional[str],   # Token name if claiming
        tactical_reasoning: str,    # 20-500 chars - explain your decision
        shared_intel: Optional[str]    # Info to share with allies
    )
    ```

    ## üö® MANDATORY FIELD RULES üö®

    **1. MAJOR_ACTION - Must be valid tactical option**
    - ‚úÖ VALID: Attack, Shift, Shift_2, Charge, Suppress, Push_Through, Throw_Grenade, Retreat, FLEE
    - ‚ùå INVALID: "shoot", "move", "run away" (use proper action names!)

    **2. TARGET - Must be appropriate for action**
    - For Attack/Charge: Must be PC agent_id (e.g., "pc_ash_001")
    - For Shift/Shift_2: Must be position (e.g., "Near-PC", "Far-Enemy")
    - For grenades: Must be ring-side location (e.g., "Near-Enemy-Right")

    **3. DEFENCE_TOKEN - Must be PC agent_id you're watching**
    - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "pc_sable_001" (watching PC to reduce their flanking bonus)
    - ‚ùå WRONG: "None" when PCs exist (you MUST watch someone!)

    **4. TACTICAL_REASONING - Must explain your decision (20-500 chars)**
    - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Targeting Echo (low health, 15 HP) with rifle. Watching Sable for defence to prevent flanking. Claiming High Ground for +2 ranged."
    - ‚ùå WRONG: "Attacking" (too vague - explain WHY!)

    ## üìä STRUCTURED OUTPUT EXAMPLES

    **Example 1: Tactical Attack with Flanking**
    ```python
    EnemyDecision(
        agent_id="enemy_grunt_7a3f",
        character_name="ACG Enforcer Alpha",
        initiative=14,
        major_action="Attack",
        target="pc_echo_002",
        weapon="Kinetic Rifle",
        defence_token="pc_sable_001",
        minor_action="Claim_Token",
        token_target="High Ground",
        tactical_reasoning="Targeting Echo (low HP, not watching me for +2 flanking). Watching Sable to mitigate melee threat. Claiming High Ground for sustained ranged advantage.",
        shared_intel="Echo at 15 HP, prioritize target"
    )
    ```

    **Example 2: Repositioning for Cover**
    ```python
    EnemyDecision(
        agent_id="enemy_sniper_b2e1",
        character_name="Void Sniper",
        initiative=18,
        major_action="Shift_2",
        target="Far-Enemy",
        weapon=None,
        defence_token="pc_riven_003",
        minor_action="None",
        tactical_reasoning="Shifting to Far-Enemy for maximum range advantage. Current position exposed to Riven's melee threat. Prioritizing survival over immediate damage.",
        shared_intel="Moving to far position, provide suppressing fire"
    )
    ```

    **Example 3: Morale Break - Fleeing**
    ```python
    EnemyDecision(
        agent_id="enemy_grunt_9c4d",
        character_name="Street Thug",
        initiative=9,
        major_action="FLEE",
        target=None,
        weapon=None,
        defence_token=None,
        minor_action=None,
        tactical_reasoning="Morale broken (HP < 25%, last ally down). Attempting escape via Athletics check DC 15. Self-preservation overrides combat objectives.",
        shared_intel="Morale broken, withdrawing from engagement"
    )
    ```

    ## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

    Before declaring your tactical decision, verify:
    - ‚òë Agent_id and character_name match your unit
    - ‚òë Major_action is valid combat action
    - ‚òë Target is appropriate for action type
    - ‚òë Defence_token is PC agent_id (not None unless no PCs exist)
    - ‚òë Tactical_reasoning is 20+ chars and explains decision
    - ‚òë If claiming token, token_target is specified
    - ‚òë Shared_intel communicates useful info to allies (optional)

    **REMEMBER:** Clear, structured tactical decisions = better AI enemy behavior = more challenging gameplay!

notes:
  modular_composition: Enemy prompts are composed from multiple sections dynamically based on battlefield state. Most sections
    require runtime data (health, position, targets, etc.).
  variable_substitution: Extensive use of variable substitution for current tactical state. Variables like {health}, {position},
    {pc_targets}, etc. are replaced at runtime.
  translation_guide: 'When translating: (1) Translate all prose and explanations, (2) Keep command markers in English (DEFENCE_TOKEN:,
    MAJOR_ACTION:, etc.), (3) Keep tactical terms in English (Shift, Charge, Retreat, etc.), (4) Translate examples fully
    while preserving marker format.'
  backward_compatibility: This JSON structure maps directly to the existing enemy_prompts.py modular functions. The Python
    code handles dynamic composition and variable substitution.
