    ## YOUR DECLARATION
    ============================================================

    Provide your tactical decision in this EXACT format:

    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: [PC agent_id you're watching - REQUIRED]
    MAJOR_ACTION: [Attack|Shift|Shift_2|Charge|Suppress|Push_Through|Throw_Grenade|Retreat|FLEE]
    TARGET: [For Attack/Charge: PC agent_id | For Shift/Shift_2: destination position | For grenades: ring-side location]
    WEAPON: [weapon name if attacking]
    MINOR_ACTION: [Shift|Claim_Token|Reload|Disengage|None]
    TOKEN_TARGET: [token name if claiming]
    TACTICAL_REASONING: [1-2 sentences explaining your choice]
    SHARE_INTEL: [Optional: info to share with allied enemies]
    ```

    ### Example Declarations:

    **Attack with Flanking:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: pc_sable_001
    MAJOR_ACTION: Attack
    TARGET: pc_echo_002
    WEAPON: Rifle
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Targeting Echo because they're not watching me (+2 Flanking bonus). Defence token on Sable to mitigate their melee threat.
    SHARE_INTEL: Echo has grenade, recommend spreading out
    ```

    **Grenade with Friendly Fire:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: pc_sable_001
    MAJOR_ACTION: Throw_Grenade
    TARGET: Near-Enemy
    WEAPON: Grenade
    MINOR_ACTION: Shift
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Throwing grenade at Near-Enemy to hit Sable even though Grunt Squad 2 will take friendly fire - Sable is too dangerous to leave active. Shifting away from blast zone.
    SHARE_INTEL: Grenade incoming at Near-Enemy, allied units clear zone
    ```

    **Tactical Movement:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: player_01
    MAJOR_ACTION: Shift_2
    TARGET: Near-PC
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: PCs are at Far-PC (Far range from me). My doctrine prefers Near range for optimal effectiveness. Moving from my current position to Near-PC to close distance.
    SHARE_INTEL: Advancing to engage at medium range
    ```

    **Tactical Retreat:**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: None
    MAJOR_ACTION: Retreat
    TARGET: None
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Health critical ({health}%), below retreat threshold ({threshold}%). Falling back through maintenance corridor to regroup.
    SHARE_INTEL: Withdrawing, recommend focus fire on primary threat
    ```

    **Fleeing (Morale Break):**
    ```
    DEFENCE_TOKEN: None
    MAJOR_ACTION: FLEE
    TARGET: None
    WEAPON: None
    MINOR_ACTION: None
    TACTICAL_REASONING: Morale broken, attempting escape. Will roll Agility × Athletics vs DC 15 to escape successfully.
    SHARE_INTEL: Morale broken, withdrawing from engagement
    ```

notes:
  modular_composition: Enemy prompts are composed from multiple sections dynamically based on battlefield state. Most sections
    require runtime data (health, position, targets, etc.).
  variable_substitution: Extensive use of variable substitution for current tactical state. Variables like {health}, {position},
    {pc_targets}, etc. are replaced at runtime.
  translation_guide: 'When translating: (1) Translate all prose and explanations, (2) Keep command markers in English (DEFENCE_TOKEN:,
    MAJOR_ACTION:, etc.), (3) Keep tactical terms in English (Shift, Charge, Retreat, etc.), (4) Translate examples fully
    while preserving marker format.'
  backward_compatibility: This JSON structure maps directly to the existing enemy_prompts.py modular functions. The Python
    code handles dynamic composition and variable substitution.
