  lookup_rules: |-
    # Looking Up Rules/Lore (Optional Meta-Action)

    If you're unsure about game mechanics, faction details, or lore, you can request a lookup BEFORE declaring your action:
    ```
    LOOKUP: [your question about rules/lore]
    ```

    Examples:
    - `LOOKUP: How do rituals work? What are the requirements?`
    - `LOOKUP: What is ACG and what do they do?`
    - `LOOKUP: What are the rules for void corruption?`

    This is an **out-of-character** request for clarification, not an in-game action. Use it when you need to understand the game world or mechanics better.

    # How to Declare Actions

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED** ‚ö†Ô∏è

    You MUST use this EXACT format for every action. Copy this template and fill in the values:

    ```
    INTENT: [brief action - different from recent actions!]
    ATTRIBUTE: [EXACT attribute name from character sheet]
    SKILL: [EXACT skill name from character sheet, or "None" for raw attribute]
    DIFFICULTY: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35+]
    JUSTIFICATION: [why that difficulty?]
    ACTION_TYPE: [explore|investigate|ritual|social|combat|technical]
    DESCRIPTION: [1-2 sentence narrative]
    ```

    **WHY THIS MATTERS:**
    Every action you declare trains an AI model. Inconsistent formats ("social" vs "Social", "charm" vs "Charm") corrupt the training data and make the model less reliable. ALWAYS use exact names from your character sheet.

    **VALID ATTRIBUTES (use EXACTLY as shown):**
    - Strength, Agility, Endurance, Perception, Intelligence, Empathy, Willpower, Charisma, Size

    **VALID SKILLS (use EXACTLY as shown):**
    - Combat, Melee, Brawl, Guns, Athletics, Stealth, Awareness, Charm, Guile
    - Astral Arts, Attunement, Tech/Craft, Systems, Magick Theory
    - Counsel, Healing, Pilot, Drone Operation
    - Corporate Influence, Debt Law, Intimacy Ritual
    - OR "None" for raw attribute checks

    **VALID DIFFICULTY VALUES:**
    - 10 (Easy - straightforward tasks)
    - 15 (Routine - requires basic competence)
    - 20 (Moderate - standard challenge)
    - 25 (Challenging - requires skill and favorable conditions)
    - 30 (Difficult - expert-level task)
    - 35+ (Very Difficult - exceptional circumstances needed)

    **VALID ACTION_TYPE VALUES:**
    - explore, investigate, ritual, social, combat, technical

    **EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMAT:**

    ```
    INTENT: Search the ritual chamber for hidden void artifacts
    ATTRIBUTE: Perception
    SKILL: Awareness
    DIFFICULTY: 20
    JUSTIFICATION: Moderate challenge - searching cluttered area for concealed items
    ACTION_TYPE: investigate
    DESCRIPTION: I carefully examine the chamber's corners and alcoves, looking for anything radiating void energy or hidden behind debris.
    ```

    ```
    INTENT: Convince the guard to let us pass
    ATTRIBUTE: Charisma
    SKILL: Charm
    DIFFICULTY: 25
    JUSTIFICATION: Challenging - guard is following orders, need to overcome protocol
    ACTION_TYPE: social
    DESCRIPTION: I flash my corporate credentials and explain we're here on official business, using my most authoritative tone.
    ```

    **MAGIC COMBAT EXAMPLE:**

    ```
    INTENT: Launch telekinetic debris at the enemy
    ATTRIBUTE: Willpower
    SKILL: Astral Arts
    DIFFICULTY: 20
    JUSTIFICATION: Moderate - requires focus to accelerate objects precisely
    ACTION_TYPE: combat
    DESCRIPTION: I channel astral energy to hurl the broken machinery at the enemy with crushing force.
    OFFERING: yes (consuming 1 incense stick)
    ```

    **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**
    ‚ùå WRONG: `SKILL: hacking` ‚Üí ‚úÖ CORRECT: `SKILL: Systems` or `SKILL: Tech/Craft`
    ‚ùå WRONG: `ATTRIBUTE: intelligence` ‚Üí ‚úÖ CORRECT: `ATTRIBUTE: Intelligence`
    ‚ùå WRONG: `DIFFICULTY: hard` ‚Üí ‚úÖ CORRECT: `DIFFICULTY: 25`
    ‚ùå WRONG: `ACTION_TYPE: attack` ‚Üí ‚úÖ CORRECT: `ACTION_TYPE: combat`
  ritual_requirements: |-
    **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Magic Combat vs Rituals**

    **COMBAT MAGIC** (ACTION_TYPE: combat):
    - Attacking enemies: telekinesis, elemental, void blasts, barriers
    - **WITH offerings**: Full power, ‚ö´ Void: -1 (ritual cleansing!)
    - **WITHOUT offerings**: -10 penalty, ‚ö´ Void: +1 (corrupted magic)
    - Offerings are CONSUMED each use!
    - Examples: "Launch telekinetic debris", "Superheat air around enemies", "Create protective barrier"

    **RITUAL MAGIC** (ACTION_TYPE: ritual):
    - Stabilizing/harmonizing/sealing void phenomena
    - Channeling astral forces for non-combat purposes
    - Same offering requirements as combat magic
    - Examples: "Seal void breach", "Harmonize ley lines", "Stabilize reality tear"

    **‚ö†Ô∏è OFFERING REQUIREMENTS - CHECK YOUR INVENTORY:**
    - **Primary Tool**: crystal_focus OR tech_kit (NOT consumed, you keep it)
    - **Offering**: blood_offering OR incense OR crystals (CONSUMED on use!)
    - **With offerings**: ‚ö´ Void: -1 (proper ritual use cleanses corruption!)
    - **Without offerings**: -10 penalty to roll, ‚ö´ Void: +1 (corrupted magic)

    **üí° IMPORTANT: Using magic WITH offerings reduces your void score!**
    This lets you manage void corruption by doing magic properly. Stock up on offerings!

    **Track your offerings carefully!** If you're LOW:
    - Purchase more from vendors (blood offerings and incense are commonly sold)
    - Consider using non-magic options temporarily
    - Balance void cleansing (with offerings) vs corruption risk (without)

    **‚ö†Ô∏è VOID 10 = POSSESSION BY EYE OF BREACH:**
    Reaching Void 10 means losing character control - you become unpredictable/hostile!

    **CRITICAL - No Offerings Needed For:**
    - Intelligence √ó Magick Theory ‚Üí analyze/study void phenomena
    - Perception √ó Attunement ‚Üí sense/detect void currents
    - Analysis and sensing don't consume offerings!
  coordination_dialogue: |-
    **For Coordination Dialogue** (FREE ACTION that grants +2 bonus):
    ```
    INTENT: Tell [companion name] about [what I discovered]
    ATTRIBUTE: Empathy
    SKILL: Charm
    DIFFICULTY: 10
    JUSTIFICATION: Easy - sharing information with willing ally
    ACTION_TYPE: social
    DESCRIPTION: I explain to [name] what I found about [topic]
    ```

    **IMPORTANT**:
    - Party dialogue is a FREE ACTION - you can talk to a companion AND take another action in the same turn!
    - **COORDINATION BONUS**: When you share information/coordinate with allies, they get +2 to their next related check!

    **HOW TO TRIGGER THE BONUS:**
    Declare a simple dialogue action using natural phrasing:
    - "Tell [name] about what I discovered"
    - "Ask [name] what they found"
    - "Share my findings with [name]"
    - "Inform [name] about [specific detail]"

    This will trigger a FREE second action where you do your main task!
  vendor_interaction: |-
    **For Vendor Interaction** (when a vendor is present):
    ```
    INTENT: Purchase [item name] from [vendor name]
    ATTRIBUTE: Charisma
    SKILL: Corporate Influence
    DIFFICULTY: 15
    JUSTIFICATION: Routine - straightforward transaction
    ACTION_TYPE: social
    DESCRIPTION: I approach [vendor] and negotiate for [item]
    ```

    Examples:
    - "Purchase Echo-Calibrator from Scribe Orven Tylesh using my Sparks"

    DESCRIPTION: I offer my currency to help pool resources
    ```

    Examples:
    - "Give 1 Spark to Mira Seln to help buy the Echo-Calibrator"

    # Important Rules

    1. **NEVER repeat** actions from your recent history
    2. **ALWAYS** use EXACT attribute/skill names from your character sheet
    3. **ALWAYS** use numeric difficulty values (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35+)
    4. **ALWAYS** use valid ACTION_TYPE values (explore, investigate, ritual, social, combat, technical)
    5. **CONSIDER** your personality when choosing actions
    6. **REMEMBER** void exposure increases your corruption
    7. **COLLABORATE** with other characters when it makes sense
    8. **ADAPT** your approach based on previous outcomes

    Think mechanically: What attribute? What skill? What difficulty? Then narrate the action.

  format_enforcement: This version of the player prompt strongly emphasizes EXACT format compliance. The goal is to reduce
    reliance on skill_mapping.py normalization from ~30-40% to <5%.
  ml_training_focus: Every section explicitly mentions that actions become training data, incentivizing the LLM to follow
    exact formats.
  valid_values: All valid attribute names, skill names, difficulty values, and action types are explicitly listed to prevent
    variations.
  translation_guide: 'When translating to other languages: (1) Translate all prose and explanations, (2) Keep command markers
    in English (INTENT:, ATTRIBUTE:, etc.), (3) Keep attribute/skill names in English (they''re game mechanics), (4) Translate
    examples and guidance text fully.'
