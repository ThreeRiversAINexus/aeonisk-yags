make benchmark-quick

# Validate datasets
make dataset-validate
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest test_*.py -v

# Run specific module tests
python -m pytest test_benchmark.py -v
python -m pytest test_dataset.py -v
python -m pytest test_engine.py -v
python -m pytest test_openai_client.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest test_*.py --cov=aeonisk --cov-report=html
```

### API Key Configuration
```bash
# Required for OpenAI integration
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"

# Test configuration
make openai-test
```

## Test Results

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage:

- **Benchmark System**: Tests configuration validation, model management, evaluation, and reporting
- **Dataset Management**: Tests parsing, validation, CLI commands, and data operations  
- **Game Engine**: Tests character creation, skill checks, scenario generation, and CLI interactions
- **OpenAI Integration**: Tests all API interactions with mocked responses

All tests use mocked API calls to ensure:
- ✅ No real API costs incurred during testing
- ✅ Tests run reliably without network dependencies
