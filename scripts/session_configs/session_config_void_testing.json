    "situation": "The party has arrived at the Harmonic Sanctum, an ancient temple built at the convergence of three major ley lines. This sacred site has been used for collaborative void purification rituals for over a thousand years. The temple's resonance field amplifies cleansing energies, making it the ideal location for deep void purification work. Each character carries significant void corruption and must work together to cleanse one another - void removal is most effective when one ritually trained person purifies another, rather than self-cleansing. The temple is peaceful and protected, allowing the party to focus entirely on their purification work without external threats. Temple doctrine teaches that mutual purification strengthens bonds and demonstrates trust - to let another touch your void-tainted spirit requires absolute faith.",
