## 8 · GM Guidance

1. **Combine Effects** judiciously. Stacking multiple +1 items should rarely exceed +3 total bonus without narrative justification.
2. **Contraband** trades always carry surveillance or Void complications—perfect plot hooks.
3. **Breaths** are excellent adventure rewards; a single Breath funds a modest feast or firmware licence.
