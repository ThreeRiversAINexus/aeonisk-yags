            <short>
                The most common form of undead.
            </short>

            <physical>
                <para>
                    Zombies are generally the unintelligent re-animated corpses
                    of the recently dead. They have flesh, often enough to still
                    be recognisable as the person they were in life, but they
                    are no longer alive, instead animated by some magic that
                    gives them purpose and movement.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Though the typical zombie is an animated corpse, this entry
                    also covers zombies which have either been animated by some
                    immoral science, or even living humans infected by some
                    disease or virus which has effectively turned them into the
                    living dead.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In either case, zombies are all similar in that they have
                    little or no will of their own, and are generally driven
                    either by hatred or hunger to attack and (often eat) those
                    who are still blessed with life.

                A living human under the influence of drugs and voodoo.
            </short>

            <physical>
                <para>
                   The zombies of Haiti myth are said to have been raised
                   with black magic to work as slaves for their masters.
                   A more rational explanation is that they have been
                   drugged and/or poisoned, leaving them in a state where
                   they have no memory of their previous life. They are
                   living people, but oblivious to much of what goes on
                   around them.
                </para>
            </physical>
            <social>
                <para>
                    Such zombies have no social life. They do what they are
                    told to do, often performing manual labour for their
                    slave masters. They have little freewill of their own,
                    and though they aren't aggressive they may be a threat
                    of directly commanded to fight. However, they are
                    generally biddable, rather than being 'controlled' by
                    anyone, and are likely to follow the commands of anyone
                    giving them direct instructions.
                </para>
                <para>
                    It has been known for such zombies to recover, and
                    start to remember part of their previous lives. If
                    they try to escape their slave masters though, they will
                    generally be hunted down and killed.

                A virus infected human.

            <physical>
                <para>
                    The <e>infected</e> are similar to zombies, but they
                    are not <e>undead</e>. Instead they are humans infected
                    by some 'natural' virus (or similar agent) that has
                    taken control of their bodies, removing their humanity
                    and leaving behind only a gaping hunger.
                </para>
                <para>
                    They are often faster moving than zombies, and can infect
                    others through wounds, or even close proximity.
                </para>
            </physical>

                <para>
                    <e>Infected</e> people are most dangerous due to their
                    numbers and the fact that they are highly contagious.
                    Against an organised group of military personnel, their
                    hordes are quite weak (at least, until the ammo runs out),
                    but if they can corner a person alone and unarmed, they
                    can be dangerous.
                </para>
                <para>
                    They count as being <e>Venomous</e>. If they strike with
                    a natural attack (fist or bite), then make a second damage
                    check for a venomous attack. If the skin is pierced, then
                    the victim becomes infected and could succumb.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The <e>potency</e> of the infection is normally 40/10,
                    and the <e>duration</e> is normally Hours, but both can
                    vary considerably depending on the setting. The effects
                    of the infection are: -1 HI / ...
                </para>
                <para>
                    If either <t>Health</t> or <t>Intelligence</t> drops to
                    zero, then the victim becomes one of the <e>Infected</e>.

                <para>
                    The <e>Infected</e> tend to gather into packs for mutual
                    protection. They are incapable of caring for themselves,
                    let alone each other, and weakened individuals will tend
                    to get turned on and eaten. They have neither morals nor
                    ethics, and are incapable of long term planning.

            <physical>
                <para>
                    Zombies are little more than animated corpses. Their
                    state of decay can vary immensely, but they generally
                    have enough flesh on their bones to hold themselves
                    together. Zombies which have rotted away to skeletons
                    are generally treated as undead <e>skeletons</e>.
                </para>
            </physical>
            <tactics>
                <para>
                    Zombies can be quite hard to kill. In most Zombie
                    stories, going for the head is the only way to kill them.
                    Because a 'living' Zombie is always conscious, you
                    cannot coup de grace them however.
                </para>
                <para>
                    An attack to the head against a fatally wounded zombie
                    will kill it immediately. It requires a good attack to
                    strike the head of a zombie. It is somewhat easier than
                    a strike at the head of a living creature, because
                    zombies are slow and more predictable.
