            <para>
                Your organisation is lacking in funds and has little or no
                income. It probably owes considerable debts, and the bulk
                of any income goes towards paying these off. Any resources
                are in a state of disrepair.

                Your organisation is profitable, and generates more money
                that it costs to run. You don't generally need to worry
                about whether bills are paid, or keeping any equipment you
                have in good working order. Making big purchases could be
                tricky however.

            <para>
                You are wealthy, and obviously so. What you own is of
                good quality, and you have significantly more starting
                money available to you (about five to ten times). You
                probably also own good property, and have no debts.

            <para>
                You cannot afford to just go out and buy anything, and
                you need an income to support your lifestyle. In a
                modern setting, you have a total worth of around
                a million pounds (including house, cars and savings).
                In a medieval setting, you will own a prosperous
                farm with healthy animals and a few servants and
                family members who help you manage the farm.

                You are rich, to the point that you could comfortably
                live the rest of your life without needing any income,
                though you'd probably have to live carefully. You
                have very good property, excellent clothes and
                equipment and plenty of savings.

                In a modern setting, your total net worth is several

                In a low technology setting, you will have a large

                few warriors as well.

            <para>
                You are very rich, one of the richest people in the
                land. In a modern setting, you have a net worth in
                the low billions and probably have many complex
                business interests, several mansions, yachts
                and plenty of friends in high places.

            <para>
                The organisation has specialists on its payroll who can
                provide services as needed. Each specialist should be
                treated as an <e>Skilled</e> level character in their own
                right, and skills should be focused in their area of
                expertise (rather than being a generalist).
            </para>
            <para>
                This can be taken multiple times in order to have multiple
                specialists available. Each time it is taken, add a number
                of specialists equal to the total cost (e.g., +1 gives you
                a single specialist, +2 gives you a total of 3, +3 gives a
                total of 6 etc).
            </para>
            <para>
                If a specialist is lost for some reason, then it will
                normally take 3-6 months to find a replacement, though this
                time will increase if the organisation suffers a large
                body count.

        <description xmlns="https://yags-rpg.net/xml">
            <para>
                The organisation has contacts who can be called on for
                advice, and sometimes favours. These contacts may be
                political, legal, military or otherwise. However, they
                are always external to the organisation.
            </para>
            <para>
                A contact will tend to be an <e>Exceptional</e> NPC
                who is specialised in their own area. Unlike specialists,
                contacts cannot always be called on at a moment's notice,
                since they have their own jobs and responsibilities.
                They are also unlikely to risk their lives or reputations
                in helping you.
            </para>
            <para>
                This can be taken multiple times in the same way that

                <e>Influence</e> is similar to a <e>Contact</e>, except
                that it is with someone who is both very friendly to your
                organisation, and who also has a lot of political power
                which can be used in your favour. They are generally a
                single <e>Heroic</e> character with a high wealth and/or
                social status.
            </para>
            <para>
                They are still external to your organisation, and are not
                dedicated to you, but the relationship is probably mutually
                beneficial and they will be more willing to stick their
                neck out than a <e>Contact</e> would.
            </para>

                Each time that this is taken, a single Influence can be

                Your organisation is able to supply small arms in enough
                quantities to outfit you and our colleagues. Small arms
                will not normally include heavy weapons such as machine
                guns or RPGs, though rare access to such heavier hardware
                may be possible on occasion.
