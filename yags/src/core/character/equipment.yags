                If you have made it this far, then you have a character and
                you know what they are capable of. The next stage is to work
                out what they <e>have</e>, in terms of equipment.

                <s>YAGS</s> does not worry too much about exactly how much
                you have at character generation. It is assumed that unless
                you've purchased one of the <e>wealth</e> advantages, then
                everyone has roughly the same amount of resources available
                to them.

                <para>
                    How much wealth you begin the game with is a complicated
                    question, and if you want a complicated answer it is
                    recommended that you have a look at <s>YAGS High Tech</s>,
                    which covers what is available in the modern period in a
                    lot more detail. However, for a quick idea of what you
                    have, the following guidelines should suffice.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Your starting wealth is how much you have immediately
                    available to buy things with, and is about equivalent to
                    a month's salary. It is assumed that basic things, such
                    as clothes, mobile phones or a set of tools for you job
                    are assumed to be had for free, depending on the society
                    in which you are based.

                <para>
                    Unless the campaign suggests otherwise, you have a regular
                    income of a similar amount <e>beyond</e> what you need to
                    spend on rent and basic food. If you are in a campaign
                    where it wouldn't make sense to be receiving this income
                    (e.g., you are independent and your adventures are your
                    full time profession), then any money you make has to be
                    made in game.

                    I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner

                <para>
                    If you want to buy something, then you need to have enough
                    money to do so. It is not always just a case of wandering
                    into the local supermarket and picking what you want off
                    a shelf however. Some items are hard to come by because
                    they are difficult to make, or are only available in
                    specialist stores. Other items are simply illegal.
                </para>

                    <title>Availability</title>

                    <para>
                        The chance of an item being available to purchase
                        locally is based on its availability rating, which
                        is a measure of how hard an item is to find. From
                        late TL 8 onwards, many things are available over
                        the internet, so in a sense even an ultra-rare item
                        is available in a small village, though it may take
                        a few days or weeks to deliver.

                            Such items are as common as dirt, and include
                            anything which can be pretty much picked up
                            off the ground, such as sticks or stones. They
                            are generally not included on equipment lists.
                            They may still have a price, which reflects the
                            trouble of someone going to pick the item up and
                            sticking it in a shop.

                            town or city to find them. However, in such places
                            they are easy to find. Handguns, mobile phones
                            and cars are examples of uncommon items.

                            to make a trip. They may also require a specialist

                        You may begin the game with anything that is uncommon

                        Though there are many items that an upstanding citizen is
                        allowed to purchase, there are some which require permission
                        first, such as guns or explosives. Beyond that, tanks and
                        rocket launchers are even more heavily restricted, and
                        nuclear weapons are things that even militaries may have
                        limited access to.

                            are good examples, as would some surveillance
