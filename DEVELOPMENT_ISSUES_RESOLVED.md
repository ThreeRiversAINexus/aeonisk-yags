# Development Issues Resolved

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend `tsx` Not Found
**Problem**: The backend development server was failing with `sh: 1: tsx: not found` error.

**Root Cause**: The `tsx` package was listed in devDependencies but not properly installed.

**Solution**: Ran `npm install` in the root directory to ensure all dependencies were properly installed.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Backend now runs successfully with `tsx watch src/index.ts`

### 2. Frontend ChromaDB Import Error
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to import `chromadb` and `better-sqlite3` packages, which are Node.js-only and cannot run in the browser. This caused Vite build errors:
```
Failed to resolve import "@chroma-core/default-embed" from "node_modules/.vite/deps/chromadb.js"
```

**Root Cause**: The frontend code was directly importing Node.js server-side packages that don't work in browsers.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `aeonisk-assistant/src/lib/rag/chromadb.ts` to use HTTP requests instead of direct ChromaDB imports
- Created a browser-compatible HTTP client that communicates with the RAG backend service
- Updated the API to match the custom backend endpoints at `http://localhost:4000`

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Frontend compiles successfully and can communicate with the backend

### 3. RAG Backend Service
**Problem**: The frontend was expecting ChromaDB to be available on port 8000, but the actual RAG backend runs on port 4000.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between frontend expectations and actual backend configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Updated frontend to use the correct RAG backend URL (`http://localhost:4000`)
- Mapped frontend functions to the correct backend API endpoints:
  - `/upsert` for adding chunks
  - `/query` for similarity search
  - `/delete` for removing chunks
  - `/clear` for clearing all chunks
  - `/health` for health checks

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - RAG backend is running and responding properly

## Current System Status

### Services Running:
1. **Backend API**: Running on port 5000 (tsx watch)
2. **RAG Backend**: Running on port 4000 (ChromaDB interface)
3. **Frontend**: Running on port 5173 (Vite dev server)

### URLs:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **RAG Backend**: http://localhost:4000

### Key Changes Made:
1. **`aeonisk-assistant/src/lib/rag/chromadb.ts`**: Complete rewrite to use HTTP client instead of Node.js imports
2. **`aeonisk-assistant/src/lib/rag/index.ts`**: Updated to use type-only imports and improved error handling
3. **Dependencies**: Ensured all npm packages are properly installed

### Browser Compatibility:
- ✅ No more Node.js-only imports in frontend code
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Vite development server starts successfully
- ✅ RAG system communicates via HTTP requests

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- RAG backend health check: `curl http://localhost:4000/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- Frontend development server: Starts successfully on port 5173

## Notes
- The system no longer requires Docker/Podman for development
- All services can be started with npm scripts
- The RAG backend uses a custom API rather than the standard ChromaDB HTTP API
- Frontend now uses proper HTTP-based communication with the backend services
