                You create a brief spark that can ignite whatever you touch.
                Materials which are highly flammable, such as oil, tinder or
                dry paper will immediately burst into flame. If the target is
                larger than the size affected, then only a portion of the
                target will immediately ignite. In the case of highly
                flammable materials, the fire will very quickly spread to
                the rest of the target though.

                or in darkness your vision may be greatly improved.
