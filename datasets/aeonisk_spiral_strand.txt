task_id: YAGS-AEONISK-100

domain:
  core: rule_application
  subdomain: ritual_navigation

scenario: >
  As your Halo-Runner exits the Spiral Strand near Arcadia, the Resonance Aligner emits a sustained shriek. The ley harmonics are unraveling mid-transit. You must perform an emergency ritual to stabilize the ship’s astral trajectory before pattern collapse warps the vessel beyond recognition.

environment: Spiral Strand approach corridor; ley rupture zones active, ships frozen in fractured resonance.

stakes: >
  Success restores partial stabilization, averts immediate slipstream failure, and opens time to investigate. Failure results in phase bleed: parts of the ship (and crew) flicker between Veil states, inflicting +1 Void and displacing the vessel from mapped ley routes.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The Aligner sparks violently. Veil energy rips through the hull; crew members scream as half their bodies flicker into translucence. The ship drifts into uncharted resonance space.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Void, ship phase-shifted off-route, one Bonded item lost to instability.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The ritual falters—enough to prevent collapse, but barely. The crew suffers psychic backlash, the ship veers off-course, and ley readings remain chaotic.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void, disoriented status for crew, unstable transit continues.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Reth stabilizes the primary node; the ship ceases flickering. The transit completes—late, rattled, but intact.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Transit succeeds with delay; crew shaken but safe.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Harmonics snap into place with only minor resistance. The vessel reenters stable space minutes from Arcadia. The Aligner logs trace Void signatures—anomalous, artificial.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Transit successful, bonus data on Void interference.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Reth not only stabilizes the ley lines but deciphers the underlying disruption pattern. The crew remains unharmed, and the vessel arrives with a predictive ley map of the fracture zone.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Arrival early, bonus advantage on next astronavigation task, +1 Soulcredit from ACG.

rationale: >
  Ritual astronavigation relies on Willpower × Astral Arts. Emergency conditions justify a Difficult (22) threshold due to ley rupture, NPC interference, and spiritual risk.

scenario: >
  Kaelia and Sorin perform a synchronized attunement rite on the Halo-Runner’s sensors while Grim helps interpret the readings, aiming to reveal all three Void-weapon clusters at once.

environment: Docking bay sensor grid; three stranded ships shimmer with disrupted ley harmonics.

stakes: >
  Success maps all three nexus points AND imbues the group with heightened resonance insight. Failure shorts out the sensor grid and inflicts psychic backlash on all participants.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The sensor grid overloads spectacularly; ley backlash scars the array, and each of you reels from raw Void echoes.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void to each participant; sensors offline for the rest of the scene.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The ritual scan fizzles in the ley-noise; the array registers only static.
      mechanical_effect: >
        No data; must retry or proceed manually.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Two clusters appear in the readout, but the third remains buried in interference.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Partial data; two nexus points mapped.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        All three clusters light up clearly on your holomap.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Full data acquired; +2 Soulcredit for the team.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Beyond mapping, you detect each ward’s unique pulse—insight that hints at their construction.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Full data plus –5 DC on the next dismantle check.

rationale: >
  A group attunement ritual harnesses each caster’s Perception×Attunement, with Grim’s observational bonus. A DC 18 reflects moderate Void interference and sensor noise.

scenario: >
  Having pinpointed the Void-weapon clusters, Kaelia turns to Lien in the comms bay to bargain for extra Spark charges and Seed-attunement kits before the strike.

environment: Halo-Runner comms bay; sensor readouts flicker behind you, crew poised on standby.

stakes: >
  Success secures vital resources for the upcoming operation; failure leaves you under-equipped and scrambling for makeshift tools.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Lien frowns at your proposal, deeming it reckless. She rescinds the Soulcredit bonus and threatens to reroute supplies to another team.
      mechanical_effect: >
        –1 Soulcredit; no extra resources.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Your pitch falls flat. Lien insists you must work with standard gear, citing protocol.
      mechanical_effect: >
        No extra resources; proceed with current loadout.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Lien nods grudgingly and allocates one additional Spark charge and one attunement kit, warning that further requests will cost Soulcredit.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Spark charge, +1 attunement kit.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Impressed by your data, Lien approves two extra Spark charges and two attunement kits—and ups your Soulcredit bonus by +1.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Spark charges, +2 attunement kits, +1 Soulcredit.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Lien not only provides the extra gear but also directs a specialist drone to assist in the upcoming operation—half a dozen additional Spark reserves at your disposal.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Spark charges, +2 attunement kits, specialist drone support, +1 Soulcredit.

rationale: >
  Negotiation relies on reading Lien’s motivations (Empathy) and leveraging your Corporate Influence. A DC 18 reflects ACG’s cautious protocol.

scenario: >
  Having scoped the three Void-weapon clusters, Kaelia targets the easiest one on the starboard hull—she’ll combine physical precision with ritual finesse to disable the embedded ward.

environment: Starboard hull access point; fissures in the plating glow with residual Void energy.

stakes: >
  Success shuts down the ward’s core, preventing its Void discharge and clearing a path for the team. Failure risks triggering a defensive backlash—an energy spike that could shred plating or harm the boarding party.

  difficulty_guess: 18
  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The ritual focus shatters against the ward’s core. A jagged pulse of Void energy erupts, scorching the hull and knocking you off your feet.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Void; hull integrity drops by 1; ward remains active.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Your timing is off. The ward flickers but holds—it retaliates with a brief burst that scorches the plating and singes your gloves.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void; ward remains active.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        You plant the Aligning Sigil flush against the ward and channel a steady surge of ritual power. The ward’s glow fades, its glyphs unraveled.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Void ward disabled; plating intact.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        The sigil flares brightly, sucking the last echoes of Void from the glyph. The ward collapses inward, leaving behind a cold, echo-free scar.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Void ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit from ACG for clean work.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Your sigil not only disables the ward but reconfigures its remaining energy into a harmless astral mote you can harvest.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Void ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit; gain 1 temporary Spark charge.

rationale: >
  Disabling a Void-ward requires precise strength under duress (Strength×Astral Arts). DC 18 reflects a “Moderate” difficulty for physical and ritual coordination amidst hull instability.

  Kaelia uses the drone’s targeting data to fire the aft Shrike Cannon at the starboard Void-ward glyph’s core, aiming to fracture its matrix with a glyph-stabilized round.

environment: Aft turret station aboard the Halo-Runner; starboard hull fissures glow with Void energy.

stakes: >
  Success shatters the ward without breaching the hull; failure risks a ricochet or hull damage and leaves the ward intact.

        The glyph-round detonates in the turret, sending a shockwave through the deck. The ward remains intact and you’re thrown back.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void; turret offline; ward still active.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Your shot grazes the ward’s edge—glyphs crack but do not collapse. The hull rattles, and the ward flares angrily.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void; partial ward disruption.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The round tears clean through the glyph matrix, and fragments drift harmlessly into space.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; hull undamaged.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Beyond shattering the ward, you sever a holding rune—its core latch flies off, ready to be repurposed.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit for precision.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The shot triggers a back-feed that dismantles nearby glyph filaments, clearing a 5 m section of hull.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit; adjacent hull segment pre-cleared.

rationale: >
  A Shrike Cannon’s glyph-stabilized burst demands precise aim (Dexterity × Guns). A DC 20 reflects the challenge of hitting a small, moving glyph under residual Void interference.

scenario: >
  After the Shrike Cannon round shattered the ward’s matrix, Kaelia plants an Aligning Sigil on the remaining glyph shards and channels a brief ritual tag to collapse any lingering Void resonance.

environment: Aft turret station aboard the Halo-Runner; hull segment now free of active glyph energy but still humming with residual Void echoes.

stakes: >
  Success collapses the last traces of Void, sealing the scar and preventing any rebound; failure leaves a volatile echo that could reignite the ward or harm the hull.

    failure:
      narrative: >
        Your sigil hums but fails to hold the residual echo. The hull quakes as the Void flickers once more.

    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The sigil glows steadily, drawing out the last echo until the hull falls silent and the scar seals.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Void echo collapsed; stable scar.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        The ritual weave not only collapses the echo but refines it into a harmless astral mote that drifts away.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Echo collapsed; +1 Soulcredit.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Your focused attunement purges the echo with such precision that nearby hull plating resonates with renewable energy.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Echo collapsed; +1 Soulcredit; next ship-based ritual gains +1 bonus.

rationale: >
  A ritual tag relies on perfectly tuning the Aligning Sigil (Willpower×Attunement). A DC 18 reflects moderate residual Void interference.

        +1 Void; Kaelia is dazed (–1 on next action); ward remains active.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Your strike cracks the glyph but doesn’t shatter it. A ripple of Void energy flares across the plating.

        +1 Void; ward partially disrupted.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The hammer connects solidly. The glyph matrix splinters, and inert shards drift away into the void.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; plating intact.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Beyond shattering the ward, your strike fissures adjacent glyph filaments, clearing a 2 m segment of hull.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Your blow not only destroys the ward but imbues the broken shards with a pulse of benign echo, which you catch in your other hand.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ward disabled; +1 Soulcredit; gain 1 temporary Spark charge.

rationale: >
  A brute-force glyph smash under hazardous EVA conditions uses Strength×Athletics. A DC 16 reflects the difficulty of striking a precise rune under duress.

    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Rook overcorrects wildly—the ship bucks in the slipstream and flickers at the molecular edge, threatening to phase out again.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void; ship drifts off-course; requires emergency ritual back-up.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The correction is sluggish. You drift a few kilometers off the intended corridor, forcing an extra course-replot.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 crew fatigue; adds one cycle delay.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Rook’s steady hands nudge the controls just right. You realign with the main ley current and hold course.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Stable transit continues; minor delay.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        The ship surges cleanly into the heart of the current, shaving hours off your estimated arrival.
      mechanical_effect: >
        –2 hours delay.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Rook’s mastery smooths out the turbulence entirely, and you even gain a minor rhythm insight into the next jump.
      mechanical_effect: >
        –4 hours delay; +1 bonus on the next slipstream jump ritual.

rationale: >
  Navigating residual slipstream turbulence is a pure piloting task—Agility×Pilot captures both reflex and finesse. A DC 20 reflects moderate post-ritual instability.

  Having disabled the Void-ward nexus, your team boards the central frozen vessel. The ship’s secondary ley node is wildly out of sync—fractured currents threaten to collapse the vessel into the Veil. You must perform a large‐scale ley repair using offerings and synchronized ritual work to re-anchor the node.

environment: Mid-ship ley node chamber; crystal conduits crackle with jagged astral energy.

stakes: >
  Success reboots the node’s harmonics, unlocking a stable slipstream corridor for the rest of the strand. Failure triggers a cascade collapse—this and nearby vessels may phase out or take structural damage.

  Having restored the central node, your team channels the Resonance Aligner’s power into the slipstream itself, weaving a sustaining ley barrier to lock the Strand’s harmonics in place as you give chase to the hidden signal.

environment: Slipstream corridor outside the vessel; currents still sputter with volatile ley energy.

stakes: >
  Success extends the node’s harmonics far enough to let you pursue without collapse. Failure lets the Strand unwind behind you—any jump now risks phasing into the Veil.

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      Your combined tuning cascades down the slipstream; the currents settle into a vibrant corridor that glows with stable ley light. You’re locked onto the signature trail.
    failure: >
      The harmonics falter mid-weave. You feel the ship shudder as the Strand behind you unravels—any jump now would be a one-way trip.

rationale: >
  Extending a repaired node’s resonance across a volatile slipstream is a high-stakes tuning task. Collective Attunement captures each caster’s finesse, with a group bonus for synergy. DC 24 reflects the extreme instability.
