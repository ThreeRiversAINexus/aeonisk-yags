domain:
  core: rule_application
  subdomain: skill_check
scenario: >
  Pokal attempts a precision strike to bypass an advanced energy barrier without triggering its sensitive security system. The barrier is calibrated to detect brute force and erratic movement.
environment: Futuristic security hub with holographic interfaces and reactive energy fields.
stakes: >
  Failure triggers lockdown and summons security drones, potentially overwhelming Pokal.

  difficulty_guess: 24
  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      Pokal angles the blade along a narrow resonance node, cutting through the field’s weakest harmonic. The barrier winks out for a single heartbeat—just long enough for him to slip inside unseen.
    failure: >
      The strike scatters the field instead of severing it. Alarms flare crimson, energy shutters slam down, and a trio of drones streak from ceiling ports to converge on Pokal’s position.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    A surgical cut demands steady hands and precise control (Dexterity) using a weapon (Melee), rather than broad athletic movement. A sophisticated security tech barrier suggests a Challenging+ target (24).

      Pokal successfully interprets encrypted schematics, uncovering key prototype enhancements and security flaws.
    failure: >
      Pokal struggles to decode encrypted intel, missing crucial strategic information.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Interpreting technical schematics uses Intelligence. Lore represents the specific knowledge domain. Searching existing data is typically Easy (15).

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      Pokal swiftly downloads complete schematics and exploits the backdoor override without triggering alarms.
    failure: >
      Pokal's hasty extraction triggers a minor security flag, data transfer is incomplete, risking detection.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Intelligence and Hacking reflect quick thinking and technical bypass. Using a known backdoor makes it easier than a standard hack, justifying an Easy (15) difficulty.

      Pokal crushes the drone's chassis with a powerful blow, disabling it immediately.
    failure: >
      Pokal’s strike glances off the drone's armor; the drone retaliates with tasers and gains tactical advantage.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Strength and Melee represent physical force and combat skill effective against mechanical adversaries. A security drone warrants a Challenging difficulty (23).

scenario: >
  Irele jacks a micro‑glyph tap into the Sentinel’s exposed service conduit, racing to inject a spoofed “all‑clear” signature before the node finishes calling in heavier security.
environment: Quarantined research pod access ring, shutters down, purge‑drones closing.
stakes: >
  Success re‑opens the corridor, aborts the alarm, and freezes the drones. Failure escalates to lethal counter‑measures and shaves two more minutes off the auto‑purge timer.

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      The Sentinel’s lattice dims to soft blue, shutters retract, and the drones power‑down mid‑stride—frozen statues awaiting new orders.
    failure: >
      The node detects the intrusion, jumps to quarantine mode, and releases a blinding pulse that overloads Irele’s tap. Drones switch to live‑fire and the pod’s purge timer drops significantly.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Overriding an active Codex security node under pressure is a cyber‑ops problem requiring analysis and code injection (Intelligence × Hacking). An active, advanced node justifies a Challenging+ difficulty (24).

  With alarms blaring and seconds ticking down, Irele decides to rip the Seed‑Cipher tank from its housing. She plans a single, perfectly‑timed hammer‑blow to the power flange, then leverage the tank free before the stasis shell recycles.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub under imminent purge; Veil‑reactive stasis field arcing unpredictably.
stakes: >
  Success shears the tank loose; Irele drags the Seed‑Cipher out—taking a scorch but beating the purge. Failure rebounds the Veil surge, inflicting +1 Void, 1 damage, and dropping the purge timer to 3 minutes.

      Metal groans and snaps; sparks fountain, but Irele wrenches the tank free and hauls it toward the exit. The field collapses in her wake—auto‑purge still has time.
    failure: >
      The flange holds. Veil energy arcs back, scorching flesh and soul alike (+1 Void, 1 damage). Alarms spike and the purge timer slams to 3 minutes—escape just turned desperate.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    This is straight-up muscle and technique (Strength × Athletics). A fortified stasis mount under purge conditions justifies a Difficult (28) target. No wound penalty applies yet.

  Blood sizzling on her scorched forearm, Irele traces a quick sigil of Binding Breath across the console and offers a smear of fresh vitae to anchor the lab’s Veil harmonics. The goal: pacify the stasis turbulence long enough to finish extraction.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub under 3‑minute purge countdown; Veil‑reactive stasis shell sparking violently.
stakes: >
  Success quenches the turbulence, halts additional Void shocks, and buys a calm 2‑minute window for further action. Failure reverberates the Veil pulse, adding +1 Void, inflicts a Will shock (–1 to ritual rolls), and drops the purge timer to 1 minute.

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      A hush falls; the stasis shell settles into a steady glow, its arcs silenced. Irele feels the Veil’s chill recede—no further Void gain—and a clear two‑minute window opens to finish the job.
    failure: >
      Sigils unravel; the Veil snarls back, lashing soul and circuitry. Irele staggers under the psychic recoil (+1 Void, Will shock), and the purge drops to a final 60‑second countdown.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Pacifying field turbulence is a Standard ritual per Aeonisk tables (threshold 18). Roll is Willpower × Astral Arts. The burn likely doesn't penalize this mental/spiritual act directly.

  Irele cracks open a maintenance panel, splices a tether into a dormant purge‑drone, and flashes a rapid‑fire exploit to seize control before Mirage Exchange can jam the signal. The plan: order the drone to clamp the Seed‑Cipher tank’s flange and add muscle for a final extraction pull.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub under 2‑minute purge; Veil turbulence suppressed but time critical.

    Rapidly spotting the correct control node and pushing an exploit under fire relies on sharp situational awareness plus cyber‑ops know‑how (Perception × Hacking). Difficulty 24 matches a Challenging security device under alert conditions.

scenario: >
  In perfect sync with the drone’s servo surge, Irele braces her burned arm, signals ‘PULL,’ and heaves. The goal: shear the Seed‑Cipher tank free before the purge flame‑jets ignite.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub; stasis shell stable (120 s window), assault team breaching nearby hatch.
stakes: >
  Success tears the tank loose—allowing immediate exfiltration with the Seed‑Cipher. Failure strains the mount but leaves it intact; the drone overloads, purge drops to 30 s, and hostiles pour in.

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      Metal screams and parts; sparks shower the deck as Irele and the drone yank the tank free. She pivots, cradling the sloshing Seed‑Cipher, and sprints for the air‑lock while the purge countdown blinks 90 s.
    failure: >
      The servo stalls; the flange only bends. Warning klaxons spike, the drone’s motor smokes, and the purge clock plummets to 30 s as Mirage operatives breach the hatch with weapons hot.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Effective Strength is Base 4 + Drone 4 = 8. Ability = 8 * Athletics 3 = 24. A minor burn likely equates to a Light Wound (-5 penalty per YAGS Combat rules). Final roll = 24 - 5 + d20 = 19 + d20. Difficulty 28 (Difficult+) for shearing a reinforced mount.

  core: rule_application

scenario: >
  Clutching the Seed‑Cipher tank, Irele bolts down the access ring toward the shuttle air‑lock, ducking stray fire from Mirage operatives and vaulting over a sparking conduit.
environment: Access ring corridor; alarms blaring, purge timer at 90 s, enemy fire incoming.
stakes: >
  Success reaches the air‑lock, seals it, and kicks off—escaping moments before the lab fire‑purges. Failure leaves Irele pinned in the corridor as flame‑jets ignite and operatives close in.

  outcome_explanation:
    success: >
      Irele slides through the air‑lock, slams the hatch, and punches thrusters as fire floods the lab behind her. The Seed‑Cipher is secure.
    failure: >
      A burst of fire clips her leg; she stumbles short of the hatch as purge flame‑jets roar down the corridor—mission teeters on disaster.
  rationale: > # Moved inside gold_answer
    Sprinting under fire uses Agility x Athletics. Base Ability = 4 * 3 = 12. A minor burn likely imposes the Light Wound penalty (-5). Final roll = 12 - 5 + d20 = 7 + d20. A full sprint under fire and obstacles is Moderate (20). (Note: Encumbrance from tank not specified, assumed negligible for this calculation, but GM could add penalty).
