scenario: >
  At the opening of the Penance Liturgical Assembly, Vehalin Halessan — Tribunal Liaison of the Breath Line — is called to assess the returning Seer’s Soulcredit status. In a sanctum lit by record-flames and surrounded by delegates, her words will define whether the Seer enters his first rite as honored, shamed, or suspended. The crowd listens. The Codex remembers.
environment: Ember Cloister Tribunal Hall — formal, echo-reactive ritual sanctum filled with Codex delegates and spiritual surveillance.
stakes: >
  A favorable reading grants the Seer a Soulcredit bonus (+1), shifting public opinion. A harsh framing risks spiritual recoil, but may curry favor with political rivals. A balanced ruling preserves stability, but opens future challenge. Vehalin’s own standing and Bond access may be affected.

    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin stammers. Her voice fails to align with the chamber’s resonance, and her words trigger dissonance. The delegates reject her framing, and her authority is diminished. The Seer is barred from ritual.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer starts with Soulcredit –1. Vehalin loses 1 Soulcredit and may face an audit.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin’s logic is cold, her phrasing too dry. The Tribunal hears her words but senses distance. The Seer is admitted — but barely.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer begins with Soulcredit –1. Vehalin's standing is neutral but unimproved.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin delivers a balanced judgment, neither damning nor exalting. Her voice is clear, her loyalty to the Codex precise. The Seer is granted entry — but no absolution.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer begins the rites at Soulcredit 0. Vehalin’s position remains strong; no gain or loss. NPC favorability remains cautious.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin’s words resonate like clean brass through the chamber. She outlines the Seer’s failings but emphasizes his procedural alignment. The delegates nod — some in agreement, others in calculation.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer begins with Soulcredit +1. Vehalin gains +1 Soulcredit or Bond Offer from a delegate.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin reframes the Seer’s exile as a necessary spiritual divergence. Her insight into Codex precedent astonishes even the archivists. The hall is briefly silent.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer begins with Soulcredit +1. Vehalin gains +1 Soulcredit and temporary immunity from ritual challenge.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The Codex itself seems to shift as she speaks. Her voice aligns with an old entry — long sealed. A flame rises unnaturally on the dais. One elder weeps.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer begins with Soulcredit +2. Vehalin gains +1 Soulcredit, +1 Bond capacity, and is recognized by the Codex for Insight. Echo potential unlocked.
rationale: >
  Vehalin used Empathy × Charm = 18; d20 roll of 3 gave her 21 total, just clearing the Moderate difficulty threshold (20). Her choice of Charm over Guile preserved spiritual integrity, avoiding Void gain or Codex friction. The result reflects balanced truth, no favor or sabotage.

  During the second ritual trial of the Penance Liturgical Assembly, Seer Halien Revane attempts to reenact his severance from a sacred Bond — the same act that led to his exile. Performed in the flame-charged Inner Veil Chamber, the rite seeks to overwrite a Codex-redacted memory through direct astral invocation. The outcome is volatile: failure invites Echo or worse.
environment: Inner Veil Chamber of the Ember Cloister — ritual braziers lit with blood-oil, Codex strata active and spiritually reactive.
stakes: >
  Success rebinds the Codex record, allowing the Seer to begin the rites of reconciliation. Failure invokes Echo backlash, imposes Void gain, and may fracture the audience’s Will — particularly those with attunement. The tribunal will remember not the act, but the pain of its echo.

    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The Codex recoils violently. Flames invert. The Seer's Echo signature collapses, and the Cloister experiences a rupture — one delegate screams and loses speech. A permanent stain marks the sanctum.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer gains +2 Void. Multiple attendees suffer psychic trauma (–2 Willpower or gain Echo condition). Reenactment ritual is locked for remainder of trial cycle.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The rite wavers. The glyphs distort mid-symbol, and the Echo of the lost Bond lashes out briefly before evaporating. A ghost of pain remains — nothing healed, nothing resolved.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer gains +1 Void. Codex refuses to update the record. Attendees must resist Echo Shock or suffer minor Willpower penalty.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The Bond’s shadow is seen, then gently unknotted — not erased, but acknowledged. The Cloister glows blue-white for three breaths, and the Codex permits a marginal update.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer gains no Void. Bond fracture acknowledged. Record slightly amended, allowing next rite to proceed with +1 ritual alignment.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        The Codex receives the rite cleanly. The fractured glyph completes, and the Echo shudders into stillness. A former Bond is named — and forgiven.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual succeeds. Codex updates fully. Seer earns +1 Soulcredit. Echo stable.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The Cloister becomes a mirror. All delegates see the fracture as it truly occurred — and witness the choice made. The Seer’s Echo integrates with the flame-glyph in perfect stillness.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Seer earns +1 Soulcredit and +1 Bond Slot (if restored). Echo stabilizes across tribunal, granting +1 to next ritual of any Witness present.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The Seer becomes a conduit. The Codex itself reweaves the glyph, absolving not just the fracture but the conditions that led to it. A forgotten name is spoken by a flame — and the audience weeps.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Full redemption unlocked. Codex restores original Bond slot and spiritual title. +2 Soulcredit. Delegates experience collective Dream-state of absolution.
rationale: >
  This reenactment rite represents the spiritual and narrative axis of the campaign. The Seer’s failure (23 vs DC 25) results in +1 Void and a disrupted ritual state. Emotional consequence is prioritized — the room staggers under a spiritual memory that remains unresolved.

  During a cloistered interlude between public ritual trials, Vehalin Halessan of the Breath Line meets with Delegate Roen Valisar in the shadowed annex of the Ember Cloister. Her goal is to secure Roen’s introduction of a tribunal clause that would limit the scope of the Seer’s next rite — a strategic containment meant to reduce Void risk and signal procedural control. The meeting is off-record but spiritually observed.
environment: Obsidian Atrium – echo-reactive tribunal annex, dimly lit, known for private maneuvering and ritualized diplomacy.
stakes: >
  Success positions Vehalin as the invisible hand behind tribunal framing. Roen becomes a temporary proxy, and the Seer’s next rite is constrained. Failure risks exposing Vehalin’s maneuver, alienating moderate delegates or lowering her Soulcredit.

        Roen interprets Vehalin’s approach as coercive and reports it to a rival faction. Rumors of procedural tampering spread before the next session. Vehalin loses 1 Soulcredit.

        Motion blocked. Seer proceeds unimpeded. Vehalin flagged for oversight.

        Roen declines, citing procedural neutrality. The tribunal remains uncontrolled, and Vehalin’s political momentum stalls.
      mechanical_effect: >

    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Roen agrees to raise concerns privately, but stops short of filing a formal clause. Tribunal tension increases; Vehalin’s influence is whispered but unconfirmed.

        Seer's next rite informally scrutinized. No formal limits, but social pressure applied.
    good_success:

        Roen consents and quietly submits a clause limiting the Seer’s Echo Dive. Other delegates nod in procedural rhythm. Vehalin’s hands remain clean.

        Seer’s ritual risk capped. Vehalin gains +1 Political Leverage over Roen.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Vehalin’s phrasing mirrors Codex precedent so precisely that Roen repeats it word-for-word in session. The clause passes unchallenged. Several delegates take note — not of Roen, but of her.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Clause implemented flawlessly. Seer’s Void gain capped. Vehalin gains +1 Political Influence tag.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The Codex itself echoes Vehalin’s phrasing in Roen’s voice. The clause enters public record as if it always belonged. Even Roen is unsure where the idea began.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Codex integration of motion. Seer’s scope hard-coded into next ritual structure. Vehalin gains +1 Soulcredit and receives a dream-fragment marked “Oathbinder.”
rationale: >
  A classic high-Charm political maneuver. Vehalin’s base ability (18) + a high roll (19) gave her 37 — far above the 22 needed to sway a cautious delegate. The excellent success outcome reflects full impact: a new clause, Vehalin’s clean hands, and a shift in tribunal tempo.
