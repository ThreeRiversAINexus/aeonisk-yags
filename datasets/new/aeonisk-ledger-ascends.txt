  Tavros acts in silence and precision. He is not the public face of the operation —
  that’s Lady Alvara. But he enforces deals, takes the spiritual risk, and gets his hands dirty so she doesn’t have to.

scenario: >
  Tavros Eluun attempts to attune a raw Spark Seed in the middle of a trade stall on Nimbus, under Codex surveillance. He uses a portable Echo-Calibrator and encrypted ritual slate to anchor the energies, performing the rite under time pressure to fulfill a deal on Lady Alvara’s behalf.

environment: Nimbus Transit Ring — crowded market stall, Codex scanner approaching, spiritual interference from nearby rituals.

stakes: >
  Success attunes the Seed and secures the trade without Void gain. Failure risks instability, +1 Void, and possible spiritual backlash. A critical failure could rupture the Seed, mark Tavros for audit, or damage the Codex scanner.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The Seed writhes, unstable. A spark lashes out — your slate cracks, the calibrator explodes in your hand, and a burst of astral energy knocks back the merchant. The Codex scanner halts, turns, and locks onto the flare.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual fails catastrophically. Codex scanner initiates audit. +2 Void. Equipment damaged. Reputation strain with Lady Alvara.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The calibration wavers. The Seed partially attunes but begins to degrade — faint crack-lines glowing with wild Spark. The merchant snatches it reluctantly, muttering about breach clauses.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual incomplete. Spark Seed becomes unstable (1d3 cycles to degrade). +1 Void. Minor trust loss with contact.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        With tight focus, Tavros completes the attunement just as the scanner passes. The Seed stabilizes — glowing a steady orange. The merchant nods once, impressed if still wary.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual succeeds. Spark Seed stable. Trade secured. No Void gained.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        The rite hums with precision. The Seed not only stabilizes but harmonizes slightly with Tavros’s will. He hands it off smoothly — Codex scanner never stops.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual succeeds with precision. +1 bonus to next trade negotiation. No Void. Merchant relation improved.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The Seed crystallizes perfectly. The merchant whispers, “You bound that better than the Ossai do.” A nearby trader takes interest — a new client, perhaps?
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual succeeds brilliantly. Gains minor reputation boost. No Void. Opens path for follow-up contract.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The resonance sings — the Seed pulses with Spark so pure it echoes through the market stall. The Codex scanner passes without registering anything at all. The merchant stares in awe. You are, unmistakably, her agent.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Ritual critically succeeds. Spark Seed attuned flawlessly. +1 Soulcredit. +2 bonus to any future deal this cycle. Codex scanner ignores you.

rationale: >
  The act of attuning a Seed on the fly is highly risky but not impossible. Willpower × Attunement is standard. The Echo-Calibrator provides narrative justification for attempting it outside a ritual altar, but the DC remains 20 due to stress, surveillance, and instability risk.

scenario: >
  Tavros seizes an opportunity with a Fractal Praxis courier attempting to offload dream-spliced biotech. Instead of accepting the gray trade as offered, Tavros escalates it: proposing a falsified transit Bond and salvage tagging the Seed through sovereign channels. He leverages his clean Soulcredit to demand a double share and spiritual immunity.

environment: Nimbus Bazaar edge-ring; Codex scanner just passed; other traders nearby, some listening in.

stakes: >
  Success secures Tavros both a share of profit and a relic-grade Living Seed under spiritual cover. Failure exposes him to Codex suspicion, damages Bond reputation with Alvara, or gains +1 Void. A critical failure may bind Tavros to the trade spiritually without his consent.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Tavros overreaches — the courier recoils, citing internal logs. A hidden Codex snare triggers nearby. The transaction flags as falsified. Alvara’s name surfaces by association.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Void. Possible Bond strain. Trade fails. Tavros flagged for Codex review.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The courier looks uncertain and says they’ll "check with higher-ups." The deal stalls. Tavros senses he’s been marked as uncooperative. Opportunity slips.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Trade offer withdrawn. No gain. -1 Trust with Fractal Praxis.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        After a tense pause, the courier nods. “Two cuts it is. We’ll run it through the salvage clause. You file it. If anything wakes... it’s on you.” The deal holds.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Trade succeeds. One Living Seed acquired. Profit secured. +1 Void optional on later use.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        “Smart. Too smart.” The courier grins — impressed. “I’ll log it with internal audit as an independent salvage ritual. Codex won’t blink.” You now have two future contacts watching.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Trade succeeds. Living Seed cleanly registered. Reputation increase. Future gray trade options unlocked.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Tavros’s maneuver draws quiet awe from a passing Choir scribe. The courier not only agrees — he offers a third deal for another Seed drop later. “Alvara really trained you?”
      mechanical_effect: >
        Trade succeeds cleanly. +1 Soulcredit. Access to classified Seed channel.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The courier bows low. “We’ll remember this. The Salvage Bond’s yours — take first pick. No Codex trace, no spiritual mark.” A low-ranking observer files the ritual silently in your favor.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Deal perfect. You gain a pristine Living Seed (any element), +1 Soulcredit, and a ritual favor from Fractal Praxis. Codex unaware.

rationale: >
  Framing a gray-market deal through Debt Law and Sovereign Bond clauses is clever and legally delicate. Intelligence × Debt Law is ideal here. DC 22 reflects the high-risk negotiation in a gray legal zone, without overt ritual backing.

  Having secured the Living Seed and a Fractal Praxis contact, Tavros ascends to Lady Sen Alvara’s orbiting chamber for a fully transparent debrief. He must present the gray-market deal, justify the risks taken, and preserve her trust.

environment: Sovereign Nexus ritual chamber—high orbit, polished sanctum, other advisors nearby listening in.

stakes: >
  Success maintains Tavros’s Bond (+2 to future rituals) and expands Alvara’s network. Failure strains the Bond, risks loss of Soulcredit, and could see Tavros reassigned or sanctioned by the Nexus.

      narrative: >
        Alvara’s eyes harden. “You risked more than your Soulcredit,” she snaps. Her advisors murmur. Tavros feels the Bond crack.
      mechanical_effect: >
        −2 Soulcredit. Bond strained (ritual penalties apply). Tavros reassigned to menial duties.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        She nods curtly but offers no praise. “Next time, inform me first.” The chamber grows cold.
      mechanical_effect: >
        −1 Soulcredit. Ritual bonus withheld. No loss of position, but trust diminished.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Alvara leans back. “Bold, but effective. The Fractal channel could serve us well.” She allows it, though with caution.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +0 Soulcredit change. Bond intact. Access to Fractal Praxis channel granted.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        A small smile appears. “Your discretion and initiative honor our Bond. Prepare the formal salvage bonds; we’ll leverage this across the Spiral Strand.” Applause from advisors.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Soulcredit. Bond strengthened (+1 to next ritual). New trade line unlocked.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        “Impressive,” Alvara says, voice warm. “You not only secured a Living Seed, you elevated our standing.” She gestures, and two scribes begin drafting high-level directives in Tavros’s name.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Soulcredit. +2 bonus on next corporate_influence roll. Formal charter to operate as her envoy.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The entire chamber rises in unified approval. Alvara embraces Tavros. “You are my blade and shield. From now on, this is your domain.” A new envoy title is conferred instantly.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +3 Soulcredit. Bond ritual automatically refreshed. Tavros gains an official Nexus envoy status (new narrative resources).

  Corporate Influence backed by genuine Empathy best reflects transparent debriefing. DC 18 captures the weight of high-orbit scrutiny and advisor presence.

environment: Lady Alvara’s orbiting sanctum, polished data‐scribe terminals, Nexus auditing protocols on standby.

stakes: >
  Success produces a manifest that passes first‐pass Nexus approval and conceals the Fractal Praxis link. Failure results in manifest rejection, triggering a Codex audit and delaying the entire operation. Critical failure could flag Alvara’s office.

        Manifest approved with commendation. +1 Soulcredit. Future admin rolls at −1 DC.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The manifest is automatically ingested into Nexus core logs as an exemplar. A senior scribe sends Tavros a personal note of thanks and a secret access token.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Manifest approved brilliantly. +2 Soulcredit. Grants one‐time “scribe’s discretion” override for a minor Nexus procedure.

  Trust the tally, not the weight.”
