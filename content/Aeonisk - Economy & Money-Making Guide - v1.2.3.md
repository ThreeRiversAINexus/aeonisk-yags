# Aeonisk - Economy & Money-Making Guide

**Version 1.2.3**
*A comprehensive guide to currency, commerce, and survival in the Aeonisk economy*

---

## Talismanic Energy Currency

The Sovereign Nexus standardized currency is **Talismanic Energy** - crystallized spiritual power stored in various denominations:

- **Breath** (smallest) - 1 unit
- **Drip** - 10 Breath
- **Grain** - 10 Drip (100 Breath)
- **Spark** (largest common unit) - 10 Grain (1000 Breath)

**Conversion is always possible** at any vendor, temple, or exchange. No fees for standard conversions.

**Starting Wealth**: Most characters begin with modest resources (5-15 Breath, 3-10 Drip, 0-3 Grain, 0-2 Spark). High-end gear often costs 4-12 Spark - more than most people have on hand.

---

## When You Can't Afford Something

### 1. Pool Resources with Party Members

**The most straightforward solution.**

Characters can combine their currency to make purchases. This is a simple social action:

- "I have 1 Spark and 7 Drip. Mira, how much do you have?"
- "Let's pool our Sparks to buy the Echo-Calibrator"
- No mechanical cost, just communication

**Currency can be transferred freely** between willing characters. This is not forming a Bond (capital B) - just simple commerce.

**Example:**
- Kress has: 1 Spark, 7 Drip
- Mira has: 0 Spark, 3 Drip, 11 Breath
- Together: 1 Spark, 10 Drip, 11 Breath
- Convert 10 Drip → 1 Grain → contribute toward higher purchases

---

## 2. Seed Economics

**Seeds are the primary way to generate income.**

### Raw Seeds → Attuned Seeds (Legal, Safe, Profitable)

**Process:**
1. Start with Raw Seed (common, degrade over time)
2. Attune at a temple/altar OR use Echo-Calibrator (costs 8 Spark to buy, but can be borrowed/rented)
3. Sell Attuned Seed to vendors

**Profit:**
- Raw Seed: ~1-2 Drip value (degrading asset)
- Attuned Seed: ~5-8 Drip value (stable, legal)
- **Net profit: 3-6 Drip per seed**

**Requirements:**
- Access to altar/temple (1 Spark fee usually) OR
- Echo-Calibrator (expensive but reusable) OR
- Willpower × Astral Arts ritual (risky, DC 25+)

**Soulcredit Impact:** None (this is legitimate ritual work)

---

### Raw Seeds → Hollow Seeds (Illegal, Risky, Very Profitable)

**Process:**
1. Allow Raw Seed to fully degrade (takes time, environmental void exposure)
2. Harvest the Hollow Seed
3. Sell on black market

**Profit:**
- Hollow Seed: ~10-15 Drip value (illicit commodity)
- **Much higher profit, but costs soulcredit**

**Risks:**
- **Soulcredit penalty:** -1 to -2 per Hollow Seed created
- Legal risk: Pantheon Security considers this contraband
- Void exposure: Hollow Seeds leak corruption
- Reputation damage with some factions

**Who buys Hollow Seeds?**
- Tempest Industries (void research)
- Underground traders
- Certain Freeborn networks
- Void cultists

**Factions that will punish you:**
- Sovereign Nexus
- Codex Cathedral
- Resonance Commune

---

## 3. Debt & Credit

### ACG Loans (Astral Commerce Group)

**ACG offers short-term credit** for those with decent soulcredit:

- **Eligibility:** Soulcredit 5+ usually required
- **Terms:** Borrow up to 10 Spark
- **Interest:** 20-30% (borrow 8, repay 10-12)
- **Soulcredit penalty:** -1 if you take a loan, another -1 if late
- **Collateral:** May require Bond or equipment as security

**ACG members get better rates** (10-15% interest, soulcredit 4+ sufficient)

**Example:**
- Need Echo-Calibrator (8 Spark)
- Borrow 8 Spark from ACG
- Repay 10 Spark within 3 sessions
- Temporary soulcredit -1 while in debt

---

### Vendor Credit / Payment Plans

Some vendors offer **"buy now, pay later"** arrangements:

- Typically 48-hour terms
- Item must be returned or paid for
- May require service/favor instead of currency
- **Salvage rights:** Vendor may want a cut of your findings

**Example from field reports:**
> "The Calibrator's yours for 48 hours, Seln, but I want salvage rights to any corrupted Seeds we stabilize."

---

## 4. Work for Payment

### Services Vendors Need

**Vendors will trade goods for services:**

- **Void Corruption Cleanup** (5-8 Spark value)
  - Clear void contamination from warehouse/shop
  - Requires ritual or technical skills
  - Risky but profitable

- **Debt Collection** (3-6 Spark, ACG specialty)
  - Recover owed currency from debtors
  - Social or intimidation-based
  - May lower soulcredit if too aggressive

- **Courier Work** (2-4 Spark)
  - Deliver goods across dangerous zones
  - Requires Pilot or Athletics
  - Void exposure risk

- **Ritual Services** (4-10 Spark)
  - Perform blessing/cleansing rituals
  - Requires Willpower × Astral Arts
  - High demand in void-exposed areas

- **Investigation** (3-8 Spark)
  - Find missing person/item
  - Requires Perception × Investigation or Awareness
  - May uncover faction secrets (risky)

**Negotiation:** Use Charisma × Corporate Influence or Empathy × Charm to set terms.

---

## 5. Barter & Alternative Payment

### Trading Goods

Vendors accept **non-currency payment:**

- **Equipment trade-in:** Old gear for partial credit
- **Ritual components:** Incense, offerings, talismans
- **Information:** Intel on competitors, void activity
- **Bonds:** Offering to form a formal Bond (extreme cases)

### Faction Favors

Some factions will front you equipment in exchange for loyalty:

- **Tempest Industries:** Gear in exchange for void research data
- **Pantheon Security:** Equipment for informant work
- **House of Vox:** Tech for exclusive stories
- **Codex Cathedral:** Ritual supplies for sacred missions

**Soulcredit impact varies** - generally safe if aligned with faction's values.

## 6. Finding Alternative Solutions

**Sometimes you don't need to buy the expensive item:**

### Echo-Calibrator Alternatives
- Use a public altar (1 Spark fee vs 8 Spark purchase)
- Find a Resonance Commune member who will attune for free (social challenge)
- Perform the ritual manually (Willpower × Astral Arts, DC 25, void risk)
- Borrow from another PC or NPC

### Medical Kit Alternatives
- Use Willpower × Astral Arts for healing (risky)
- Find a Codex Cathedral healer (free but may require service)
- Improvise with lower-quality supplies (Drip-level items)

### Tech Alternatives
- Hack or bypass instead of buying access codes
- Steal (very risky, major soulcredit penalty)
- Social engineer your way past security

## Economic Strategy Tips

### If You're Broke
1. **Pool with party** (instant, no cost)
2. **Convert/attune a Raw Seed** (3-6 Drip profit)
3. **Offer service to vendor** (negotiate trade)
4. **Take ACG loan** (if soulcredit 5+, 20% interest)
5. **Find alternative solution** (altar vs buying Calibrator)

### If You're Desperate
1. **Create Hollow Seed** (-1 to -2 soulcredit, 10-15 Drip)
2. **Steal** (major soulcredit penalty, legal risk)
3. **Form Bond as collateral** (extreme, long-term commitment)

### Building Wealth
- **Attune and sell seeds regularly** (sustainable income)
- **Complete vendor contracts** (builds reputation)
- **Maintain high soulcredit** (better loan terms, vendor trust)
- **Invest in reusable tools** (Echo-Calibrator pays for itself)

---

## Soulcredit & Economic Trust

**Soulcredit is your spiritual credit score** (0-10 scale):

- **8-10:** Excellent - vendors give discounts, ACG offers best loan terms
- **5-7:** Good - standard prices, loans available
- **3-4:** Fair - vendors wary, higher interest rates
- **0-2:** Poor - many vendors refuse service, ACG won't lend

**What lowers soulcredit:**
- Creating Hollow Seeds (-1 to -2)
- Taking loans (-1 temporary)
- Late loan payments (-1 additional)
- Stealing, fraud, betrayal (-2 to -5)
- Void corruption exposure (situational)

**What raises soulcredit:**
- Completing sacred missions (+1)
- Paying debts on time (+1)
- Forming legitimate Bonds (+1)
- Ritual service to community (+1)

## Example: The Echo-Calibrator Problem

**Scenario:** You need an Echo-Calibrator (8 Spark) but only have 1 Spark.

### Solution Path A: Pool Resources
1. Ask party member: "How much currency do you have?"
2. Combine funds
3. Purchase together, share the tool

### Solution Path B: Seed Economics
1. Attune your Raw Seed at an altar (1 Spark fee)
2. Sell Attuned Seed for 5-8 Drip
3. Still short, but closer
4. Offer vendor a service contract for remaining value

### Solution Path C: Debt
1. Approach ACG vendor for loan
2. Borrow 8 Spark at 20% interest
3. Buy Calibrator
4. Earn money via side jobs to repay 10 Spark

### Solution Path D: Alternative
1. Don't buy it - find a public altar instead
2. Costs only 1 Spark (you already have this!)
3. Same result, much cheaper

### Solution Path E: Service Trade
1. Offer to clear vendor's void-contaminated storage (5-8 Spark value)
2. Receive Calibrator as payment
3. Complete the job

## Final Thoughts

**Economic scarcity is a feature, not a bug.** When you can't afford something, you're being presented with an interesting problem that requires creativity, cooperation, and risk assessment.

The economy creates meaningful choices:
- **Fast but risky** (Hollow Seeds, theft)
- **Slow but safe** (attune Seeds, side jobs)
- **Cooperative** (pool resources, share tools)
- **Clever** (alternative solutions, negotiation)

Embrace the scarcity. It makes your victories meaningful.

*May your soulcredit stay high and your Sparks plentiful.*
