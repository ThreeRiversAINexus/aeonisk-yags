# Aeonisk - YAGS Module

*“Will is Power. Bond is Law. Void is Real.”*

Version 1.0.1

## 1. Introduction

Aeonisk is a science-fantasy roleplaying setting built on intimacy, intention, and control, using the **Yet Another Game System (YAGS)** as its foundation. In this world, there are no nations — only factions, dynasties, and spiritual economies. Technology hums in harmony with  magick. Rituals shape reality. Bonds bind more than blood.

You are a wielder of Will. You live in a world where to act is to mean  something — and to mean something is dangerous. This module adapts the  YAGS system into a framework for stories about:

- Sacred trust and betrayal
- Power bought with spirit, not coin
- The slow erosion of self under the weight of debt, duty, or the Void

You may rise through purpose, or fall through sacrifice. But either way: the Astral is watching.

### 1.1. What Kind of Game is Aeonisk?

Aeonisk YAGS focuses on:

- Emotional and spiritual tension, not just physical conflict.
- Ritual magick with consequences, cost, and deep symbolism.
- Formally declared Bonds as party cohesion and narrative anchors.
- A real spiritual economy of Soulcredit and ritual debt.
- The creeping influence of the Void as temptation and corruption.

It is ideal for:

- GMs who love story-first design with consequence-driven mechanics.
- Players who want their character’s choices to echo in the Astral.
- Groups comfortable with intimacy, ideology, and irreversible sacrifice.

### 1.2. The Core Trinity of Aeonisk

- **Will:** Your purpose — not your desire, but your alignment with the world’s  hidden pattern. Following it empowers you. Betraying it breaks you.
- **Bond:** A sacred, formal connection. Emotional, spiritual, sometimes political — but never casual. Bonds are the true structure of parties, not classes.
- **Void:** The result of power without connection. Isolation made manifest. The  astral price of intention unanchored to empathy or sacrifice.

### 1.3. YAGS System Integration

Aeonisk uses the core YAGS mechanics but modifies or adds the following:

| System Element        | Aeonisk YAGS Modification                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core Dice Mechanic    | Skill Attribute × Skill + d20                                |
| Ritual Resolution     | Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 vs Difficulty Threshold        |
| Cost Roll             | Rituals require a Cost Roll: Willpower + d20 ≥ Cost Threshold |
| New Skills            | Astral Arts, Magick Theory, Intimacy Ritual, Corporate Influence, Debt Law (examples) |
| Void Score            | Tracks spiritual corruption (0–10); affects Bonding, rituals, and narrative tone. |
| Soulcredit            | Tracks spiritual trust and obligation (–10 to +10).          |
| Bond Mechanics        | Formal connections (max 3, Freeborn 1). Provides +2 to rituals and +1 Soak (defending Bonded). Can be sacrificed. |
| Ritual Tools          | Requires a Primary Ritual Item (non-consumable) and a sacrificial Offering (consumed). No offering = +1 Void. |
| Tech/Enchantments     | Require significant offerings, narrative weight, and carry Void risk or spiritual cost. May interact with Soulcredit/Will. |
| Initiative (Optional) | Agility × 4 + d20                                            |

## 2. Core YAGS Mechanics

YAGS uses a relatively simple set of core rules.

### 2.1. Terminology

- **Attribute:** One of the eight basic numbers defining a creature. Typical human average is 3.
- **Skill:** Defines training and experience in a narrow field. Combined with Attributes for task resolution. Professional level is 4+.
- **Ability:** Attribute × Skill (for Skill Checks) or Attribute × 4 (for pure Attribute Checks).
- **Die:** A single twenty-sided die (d20).
- **Difficulty:** The target number for a task. Ability + d20 must meet or exceed the Difficulty. Moderate tasks are Difficulty 20.
- **Task:** An activity requiring an Ability check (Attribute × Skill + d20 or Attribute × 4 + d20).
- **Score:** The raw numerical value of a characteristic.

### 2.2. Task Resolution

The core mechanic for almost all actions:

Ability + d20 vs Difficulty

- **Skill Check:** Attribute × Skill + d20 vs Difficulty
- **Attribute Check:** Attribute × 4 + d20 vs Difficulty

**Difficulties (YAGS Standard):**

| Type           | Target | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Very easy      | 10     | Minimal skill needed. Professionals always succeed.          |
| Easy           | 15     | Small amount of skill needed. Difficult for untrained.       |
| Moderate       | 20     | Achievable by professionals in ideal conditions. Difficult without. |
| Challenging    | 25     | Requires professional skill. Out of league for basic familiarity. |
| Difficult      | 30     | Requires high skill. Even professionals hard pressed.        |
| Very difficult | 40     | Master level required. Highest difficulty in normal circumstances. |
| Extreme        | 50     | Very difficult task under poor conditions.                   |
| Heroic         | 60     | Truly heroic.                                                |
| Sheer folly    | 75     | Requires superhuman skill.                                   |
| Absurd         | 100    | Beyond most capabilities.                                    |

*(Aeonisk typically uses a narrower range of 15-20 for standard Skill Checks, but Rituals have their own specific thresholds. GMs can use the YAGS  standard for non-ritual tasks).*

**Fumbles & Criticals:**

- A natural '1' on the d20 is an automatic failure (fumble).
- A natural '20' on the d20 in a Skill Contest automatically wins if your skill score is higher than the opponent's.

**Degrees of Success:**
If how well you succeed matters:

- **Moderate Success:** Meet the Difficulty.
- **Good Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 10+. (Task performed with style, completeness, or speed).
- **Excellent Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 20+. (Performed with two of style/completeness/speed).
- **Superb Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 30+. (Performed with style, completeness, *and* speed).
- **Fantastic Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 40+.
- **Amazing Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 50+. (Close to perfection).

**Skill Contests:**
Instead of a fixed Difficulty, two or more characters roll their relevant Ability + d20.

- Highest roll wins.
- On a tie, the character with the higher Skill *score* wins.
- A natural '20' wins automatically if your Skill score is higher.

**Skilled Professionals (Skill 4+):**
Professionals have extra options for predictable, non-opposed tasks:

- **Assume '0':** For predictable tasks, assume a d20 roll of '0'. Negates fumble chance but requires the task to be well within capability.
- **Assume '10':** For non-stressful tasks where you can take time, assume a d20 roll of '10'. Removes fumble risk but takes twice as long.
  *(GM decides if a task is predictable/stressful. If fumble chance > 1, these options cannot be taken).*

### 2.3. Attributes

Eight primary attributes define raw potential. Human average is 3, range typically 2-5 (higher is rare).

- **Strength (Str):** Physical power, lifting, hurting, breaking things. Carrying capacity is based on Str^2.
- **Health (Hea):** Endurance, fitness, resisting injury/poison/fatigue, staying conscious.
- **Agility (Agi):** Quickness, acrobatics, balance, dodging, brawling.
- **Dexterity (Dex):** Hand-eye coordination, sleight-of-hand, melee/pistol skills, driving.
- **Perception (Per):** Alertness, senses (vision, hearing), observation, noticing things. Used for rifles/bows.
- **Intelligence (Int):** Wit, cunning, memory, intuition, logic, knowledge skills.
- **Empathy (Emp):** Understanding others, manipulation, reaction, charisma base.
- **Willpower (Wil):** Mental fortitude, resisting fear/magic/temptation, concentration, lying. Key for Aeonisk Rituals.

**Attribute Levels (Human Norm):**

| Score | Level       | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | None        | No rateable ability. Cannot attempt skills using it.         |
| 1     | Crippled    | Severely impaired (very dumb, ill, socially inept).          |
| 2     | Poor        | Noticeably below average (bottom 10%). Minimum possible for most. |
| 3     | Average     | Middle 80% of the population.                                |
| 4     | High        | Noticeably above average (top 10%).                          |
| 5     | Very High   | Highly adept naturally. Highest natural level without training. |
| 6     | Exceptional | Truly exceptional, trained hard. Hard to compete against.    |

| 9+    | Superhuman  | Beyond natural possibility.                                  |

**Secondary Attributes:**

- **Size:** Defaults to 5 for adult humans (range 4-6). Governs soak capacity and wound levels. Logarithmic scale (see YAGS rules).
- **Move:** Determines speed. Equal to Size + Strength + Agility + 1. (Typical human: 5+3+3+1 = 12). Combat move = Move / 2 (rounded down).
- **Soak:** Base resistance to damage. Defaults to 12 for adult humans. Modified by armour.

### 2.4. Skills

Skills represent training and experience. Most default to 0 unless learned.

**Skill Levels:**

| Level | Description           | Notes                                                        |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Casual                | Basic familiarity (single lesson, brief exposure).           |
| 2-3   | Student               | Studied in school or reasonable practice. Succeeds at easy tasks. |
| 4-7   | Professional          | Competent professional (4-5). Seasoned veteran (6-7). Can buy Techniques. |
| 8-11  | Master                | True understanding, years of dedicated study. Elite level.   |
| 12-15 | Legendary             | Highest level found in most worlds. Leaders in their field.  |
| 16+   | Mythical / Superhuman | Province of superheroes or supernatural beings.              |

**Types of Skills (YAGS Standard):**

- **Talents:** 8 core skills known to some extent by all humans (start at 2).  Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile, Sleight, Stealth, Throw.
- **Knowledges:** Theoretical knowledge, must be learned (Skill 1+). Cannot be used untrained.
- **Languages:** Rated 1-4+ for fluency. Not typically rolled.
- **Standard Skills:** Mix of knowledge, experience, aptitude. Can be used untrained, but roll (straight d20) is halved, fumble on 1 or 2.

**Skill Defaults:**
Some skills can default to others (often a Talent). When using a default:

- Final result (Attribute × Skill + d20) is halved.
- Fumble chance is doubled (or minimum 2 if it was 1).
- Cannot use Techniques.

**Skill Pre-requisites:**
Some skills require others at a certain level before they can be learned.

- Must meet all pre-requisites before buying Skill level 1.
- A skill can never be more than double the level of any of its pre-requisites.

**Techniques:**
Specialisations bought with experience points, allowing bonuses or special actions.

- Require a minimum skill level equal to their cost.
- May have prerequisite techniques.
- **Familiarities:** Required for skills covering diverse equipment (e.g., Drive). Cost 2-4 points. Using without familiarity halves roll.
- **Specialisations:** Focus knowledge (e.g., History [English Civil War]). Makes specific tasks easier.
- **Masteries:** Levelled specialisations (cost 1 per level) for competitive/artistic  skills. Grant +1 bonus per level. Opponents with lower mastery suffer +1 fumble chance per level difference.

## 3. Aeonisk Core Mechanics

Aeonisk builds upon YAGS, adding unique systems for rituals, spiritual standing, and personal destiny.

### 3.1. Rituals

Rituals are acts of intention, symbolism, and sacrifice, not simple spells. They channel Will through the Astral.

- **Ritual Roll:** Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 [+2 if Bonded participant assists] vs Ritual Threshold.
- **Cost Roll:** If Ritual Roll succeeds, make a Cost Roll: Willpower + d20 vs Cost Threshold.

**Ritual Thresholds & Costs:**

| Type      | Ritual Threshold | Cost Threshold | Description                                                |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minor     | 16               | 16             | Emotional veil, symbolic marking, light defense            |
| Standard  | 18               | 18             | Bond reinforcement, magickal tracking, simple bindings     |
| Major     | 20–22            | 20–22          | Contract severing, astral healing, memory reweaving        |
| Forbidden | 26–28            | 26–28          | Soul extraction, resurrection, Void channeling (High Void) |

**Requirements:**

- **Primary Ritual Item:** A non-consumable item, sacred to the caster. Required for meaningful  rituals. If lost: –2 to Ritual Rolls, triggers Cost Roll on casting.
- **Offering:** A consumable item or concept (emotion, memory, blood, object)  symbolically appropriate to the ritual's intent. Burned, buried, bled,  spoken, etc.
  - **Skipping Offering:** Gain +1 Void. GM may increase difficulty or cause instability. Unethical intent also triggers Void penalty.

*(See Section 6 for detailed Ritual Rules).*

### 3.2. Soulcredit & Void

These track spiritual alignment and trustworthiness.

- **Soulcredit (SC):** –10 to +10. Represents spiritual trust and standing.
  - *Gain:* Fulfill contracts, aid rituals, cleanse Void.
  - *Lose:* Break Bonds/contracts, ritual without offering, betray True Will.
  - *Effects:* Influences faction relations, access to tech/rituals. (+6 to +10 = Trusted; –6 to –10 = Hunted/Cut Off).
- **Void Score (VS):** 0 to 10. Represents spiritual corruption and disconnection.
  - *Gain:* Skip offerings, unethical rituals, break True Will, use Void-forged items.
  - *Effects:*
    - 5+: Rituals may misfire, attract entities.
    - 7+: Cannot form/maintain Bonds; sacred sites reject you.
    - 10: Claimed by the Void (potential loss of agency).
  - *Cleanse:* Ritual at ley site, restore Bond, sacrifice something irreplaceable.

*(See Section 7 for detailed Void & Soulcredit Rules).*

### 3.3. Bonds

Formal, mutual metaphysical connections based on ritual or oath. The backbone of relationships and party structure.

- **Limit:** Max 3 Bonds (Freeborn origin: 1).
- **Benefits:**
  - +2 to Ritual Rolls when performing together.
  - +1 Soak when defending a Bonded partner.
- **Sacrifice a Bond (Sever):** Once per session, gain +5 to *any* Willpower-based roll.
  - *Cost:* +1 Void, +1 Soul Debt (to the severed person), –1 Empathy for the scene. A major narrative and spiritual act.

*(See Section 8 for detailed Bond Rules).*

### 3.4. True Will

Your soul’s sacred trajectory or purpose. Not a motto, but a metaphysical path.

- **Declaration:** Starts undefined. Declared mid-play through insight, ritual, or character growth.
- **Alignment:** Acting *in* alignment grants +1 to *all* Willpower-based rolls.
- **Betrayal:** Acting *against* declared True Will incurs +3 Void and triggers a narrative/spiritual crisis (GM discretion).

*(See Section 8 for more on True Will).*

### 3.5. Aeonisk Currency: Elemental Economy

Aeonisk uses charged elemental talismans instead of abstract money. Value is transferred energy.

- **Types:** Grain (Earth), Drip (Water), Spark (Fire), Breath (Air). Each represents different conceptual energies.
- **Forbidden:** Hollow (Void) - Black market, corrupting.
- **Potential:** Seed (Unaligned) - Cannot be traded, must be attuned through ritual/sacrifice.
- **Usage:** Energy is siphoned from talismans (e.g., Spark Core 743/1000) to pay  others or power devices. Empty talismans can be recharged or sacrificed.
- **Sizes:** Single (1 unit), Band (10-99), Sigil (100-999), Core (1k-9.9k), Vault (10k+).

*(See Section 9 for detailed Currency Rules).*

## 4. Character Creation

Create an Aeonisk character using YAGS principles, modified by the setting's unique elements.

### 4.1. Step 1: Concept & Priority

Decide on your character concept. The GM sets the starting power level  (Mundane, Skilled, Exceptional, Heroic - see YAGS Characters PDF), which determines points pools. Prioritize the three point pools (Attributes,  Experience, Advantages) into Primary, Secondary, Tertiary based on your  concept.

### 4.2. Step 2: Choose Origin (Faction/Background)

Select an Origin. This grants an Attribute bonus (+1 to one of two listed stats) and a special trait.

| Origin                | Attribute Bonus (+1)    | Trait                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sovereign Nexus       | Willpower or Int        | **Indoctrinated:** +2 to resist ritual disruption or mental influence. |
| Astral Commerce Group | Intelligence or Emp     | **Contract-Bound:** Start with +1 Soulcredit or one favourable minor contract/debt owed *to* you. |
| Pantheon Security     | Strength or Agility     | **Tactical Protocol:** Once per combat, automatically succeed on an Initiative roll (treat as 20). |
| Aether Dynamics       | Empathy or Perception   | **Ley Sense:** Can sense the presence, general strength, and mood (calm/turbulent) of nearby ley lines. |
| Arcane Genetics       | Health or Dexterity     | **Bio-Stabilized:** +2 to rolls resisting biological Void effects, disease, or mutation. |
| Tempest Industries    | Dexterity or Perception | **Disruptor:** +2 bonus when attempting to sabotage or hijack rituals or ritually-encoded tech. |
| Freeborn / Unbound    | Any Attribute           | **Wild Will:** Can only form/maintain 1 Bond. Cannot sacrifice this Bond without extreme cost (GM call). |

*(Note: Attribute names updated slightly from source for clarity/consistency).*

### 4.3. Step 3: Assign Attributes

Distribute points into the 8 primary YAGS attributes (Str, Hea, Agi, Dex, Per,  Int, Emp, Wil) according to your chosen priority level and point pool.  Remember the human average is 3. Apply your +1 Origin bonus *after* spending points. Check maximum attribute level allowed by campaign level.

### 4.4. Step 4: Choose Skills

Spend Experience points on Skills. Select from the YAGS core list or  Aeonisk-specific skills. All characters start with the 8 Talents  (Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile, Sleight, Stealth, Throw) at  level 2 for free. Check maximum skill level allowed by campaign level.

**Aeonisk Skills:**

| Skill               | Attribute | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Astral Arts         | Willpower | Channeling, resisting, and shaping spiritual energies in rituals. |
| Magick Theory       | Int       | Knowledge of glyphs, ritual systems, sacred mechanics, Aeons. |
| Intimacy Ritual     | Empathy   | Performing emotionally-powered or Bond-based rituals. Requires trust. |
| Corporate Influence | Emp       | Navigating faction politics, extracting favors, reading intentions. |
| Debt Law            | Int       | Understanding/manipulating contracts, oaths, Soulcredit systems. |

### 4.5. Step 5: Define True Will (Later)

Leave your True Will undefined for now. It will emerge and be declared during play.

### 4.6. Step 6: Form Bonds (Optional)

You start with no Bonds unless determined otherwise by the GM or through  spending Advantage points (if allowed). Bonds are formed in-game through ritual or oath. Max 3 (Freeborn: 1).

### 4.7. Step 7: Gather Ritual Kit & Equipment

- **Primary Ritual Item (1):** Define a personal, sacred item. Narratively important, mechanical effect if lost (-2 Rituals, Cost Roll).
- **Offerings (1-3):** Define 1-3 starting consumable offerings appropriate to your character concept.
- **Starting Currency:** GM determines starting elemental currency based on TL and background  (e.g., equivalent to YAGS starting cash, converted to elemental  talismans).
- **Other Gear:** Basic clothing, tools of trade are assumed. Spend remaining starting  funds or use Advantage points for significant items (weapons, armour,  tech).

### 4.8. Step 8: Calculate Secondary Attributes & Final Checks

- **Size:** Default 5 (human).
- **Move:** Size + Str + Agi + 1.
- **Soak:** Base 12 (human). Add armour bonuses.
- **Void Score:** Starts at 0.
- **Soulcredit:** Starts at 0.
- **Wound/Stun/Fatigue Levels:** Based on Size (Humans typically have 5 levels before Fatal/Out/Exhausted).

## 5. Combat Rules (Optional System)

Combat uses the YAGS core loop, potentially modified by Aeonisk elements. GMs may opt for more narrative resolution.

### 5.1. Combat Round (~5 seconds)

1. **Roll Initiative:** (Once per combat)
   Initiative = Agility × 4 + d20

   - High roll acts earlier.
   - Fumble (natural 1): Initiative becomes 0. All rolls halved for the round, actions are Slow.

2. **Declare Actions:** (In *increasing* initiative order - lowest goes first)

   - State intended action (attack, move, defend, wait, ritual, etc.).
   - Declare number of defences (Max = Average of Agility & Perception, round up; typically 3 for humans).

3. **Resolve Actions:** (In *decreasing* initiative order - highest goes first)

   - **Fast Actions:** Resolve first. (e.g., Quick Shot, some manoeuvres).
   - **Normal Actions:** Resolve next. (e.g., Standard Attack, Move + Attack).
   - **Slow Actions:** Resolve last. (e.g., Sprint + Attack, Aimed Shot, most Rituals).

4. **Make Attacks:**

   - **Attack Roll:** Attribute × Skill + Weapon Bonus + d20
     *(Attribute/Skill depends on weapon: e.g., Dex × Melee, Per × Guns, Agi × Brawl)*
   - **Defense Roll:** Attribute × Skill + Weapon Defense + d20
     *(Usually same Attribute/Skill as attack type being defended against)*
   - **Hit:** If Attack Roll ≥ Defense Roll. (If not defending, Attack Roll vs base Difficulty 15).

5. **Inflict Damage:**

   - **Damage Roll:** Strength × 1 + Weapon Damage + d20
   - **Soak:** Target's base Soak + Armour bonus.
   - **Effect:** If Damage Roll ≥ Soak, deal Wounds or Stuns. 1 level per 5 points damage exceeds Soak.

6. **Track Wounds/Stuns:**

   | Wounds | Stuns | Penalty | Description                     |
   | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
   | 1      | 1-2   | -       | Minor (Bruised)                 |
   | 2      | 3     | -5      | Light (Lightly Wounded/Stunned) |
   | 3      | 4     | -10     | Moderate (Wounded/Stunned)      |
   | 4      | 5     | -15     | Heavy (Seriously Wounded/Dazed) |
   | 5      | 6+    | -25     | Critical (Critical/Beaten)      |
   | 6+     | -     | -40     | Fatal (Health check or die)     |

   - Wounds track lasting injury. Stuns track temporary impact/bruising. Penalties stack!
   - *Damage Types:* Wound (swords, bullets), Stun (fists, clubs), Mixed (knives; half wounds, half stuns).

7. **End of Round:**

   - Make Health checks to stay conscious if Critical/Fatal/Beaten.
   - Apply ongoing effects (bleeding, poison, rituals, Void).
   - Start next round (Declare Actions).

### 5.2. Aeonisk Combat Considerations

- **Void:** High Void score (5+) can cause fumbles, misfires, or tech glitches. GM intrusion possible.
- **Bonds:** Gain +1 Soak when actively defending a Bonded partner from an attack targeting them.
- **Technology:** Weapon properties (Glyph, Void, Contractual) apply. Tech may malfunction due to Void or low Soulcredit.
- **Rituals in Combat:** Usually Slow actions. Require concentration (Focused stance - no defense). Interrupting a ritual can cause backlash.

## 6. Ritual System (Detailed)

Power flows through sacrifice. Without offering, there is only Void. Rituals  alter emotion, memory, contracts, spiritual structure, or reality.

### 6.1. Performing a Ritual

1. **State Intent:** Clearly define the ritual's purpose (e.g., "Reinforce my Bond with Wren," "Cleanse this area of Void residue").

2. **Gather Components:**

   - **Primary Ritual Item:** Must be held/present. Personal, sacred. Loss incurs -2 penalty to Ritual rolls and auto-triggers a Cost Roll on success.
   - **Offering:** Consumed during the ritual. Must be symbolically relevant. Skipping incurs +1 Void and potential GM penalties.

3. **Roll Ritual:** Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 [+2 if Bonded participant assists]

4. **Check Success:** Compare result to the Ritual Threshold.

   | Type      | Ritual Threshold |
   | --------- | ---------------- |
   | Minor     | 16               |
   | Standard  | 18               |
   | Major     | 20–22            |
   | Forbidden | 26–28            |

5. **Roll Cost (If Successful):** Willpower + d20 vs Cost Threshold.

   | Type      | Cost Threshold |
   | --------- | -------------- |
   | Minor     | 16             |
   | Standard  | 18             |
   | Major     | 20–22          |
   | Forbidden | 26–28          |

6. **Adjudicate Outcome:** GM describes the effects based on success/failure of both rolls, intent, and context.

### 6.2. Failure Consequences

- **Ritual Roll Failure:** Ritual fails. May cause backlash: emotional drain (-Empathy), Void gain, entity attention, Bond strain, reversal of intent.
- **Cost Roll Failure (Margin):**
  - **1-4:** Emotional fatigue (–1 Willpower or Empathy for 1 scene). Minor spiritual static.
  - **5-9:** Astral backlash (+1 Void, become spiritually visible/vulnerable for a scene). Minor unintended side effect.
  - **10+:** Significant consequence: ritual corruption (twists intent), Bond  strain/fracture, spontaneous Void event, attracts hostile entity.

### 6.3. Group Rituals

- Requires mutual Bonds among participants.
- Lead caster makes the Ritual Roll (gains Bond Bonus if applicable).
- Each participant must provide their *own* Offering.
- Each participant makes their *own* Cost Roll if the ritual succeeds. Failure affects the individual.

### 6.4. Void and Rituals

- **Void ≥ 5:** Rituals may misfire, attract entities, have twisted outcomes. GM may invoke Ritual Fallout (see GM Toolkit).
- **Void ≥ 7:** Cannot participate in group rituals. Own rituals prone to severe corruption. Bonds are spiritually inactive.

### 6.5. Ritual Library v1 (Examples)

*(See Appendix 2 for full list and template)*

**Minor (16/16):**

1. **Veil the Thread:** Conceal a Bond from detection (1 scene). *Offering:* Knotted hair, burned.

2. **Red Exchange:** Permanently transfer ritual debt. *Offering:* Shared wound, silver thread.
3. **Skin of the Hollow:** Gain target's skill (-2) for 1 scene. *Offering:* Token imbued with memory.

**Forbidden (26-28 / 26-28):**

1. **Last Whisper of the Hollow:** Speak with Claimed soul (1 scene). *Offering:* Bone/hair of deceased, salt, blood. *Void:* +3 always.

## 7. Void & Soulcredit System (Detailed)

*“Every act is a signature. Every signature leaves a mark.”*

### 7.1. Void Score (0-10)

Measures spiritual corruption, disconnection, and proximity to being Claimed.

**Effects by Score:**

| Score | State     | Effects                                                      |

| Sacrifice Something Irreplaceable              | -3       | Truly significant: relic, core memory, power, relationship feature. One time. |

### 7.2. Soulcredit (SC) (–10 to +10)

Measures spiritual reputation, integrity, and trustworthiness within the metaphysical economy.

**Effects by Score (Optional Social Rules):**

| Score     | Status                 | Social/Factional Effects                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| +6 to +10 | Ritually Exalted       | Trusted by sacred factions (Nexus), access to high-tier rituals/tech. Leaders. |
| +1 to +5  | Clean / Reliable       | Generally accepted, standard access.                         |
| 0         | Neutral / Unknown      | Default starting state. No strong opinions either way.       |
| -1 to -5  | Flagged / Unreliable   | Watched by auditors (ACG), limited access, social suspicion. |
| -6 to -9  | Rejected / Debt-Marked | Excluded from sacred spaces/rituals, hunted by debt collectors, pariah status. |
| -10       | Spiritually Bankrupt   | Considered astrally toxic, null. May be targeted for cleansing/containment. |

**Gaining Soulcredit:**

| Action                               | SC + | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Public Ritual (aligned w/ Bond/Will) | +2   | Must be witnessed, significant, and successful.              |
| Cleanse Void Site/Person             | +2-3 | Based on severity of Void and risk involved.                 |
| Uphold Faction Tenets (at cost)      | +1   | e.g., Nexus upholding doctrine, ACG enforcing Debt Law fairly. |

**Losing Soulcredit:**

| Action                               | SC – | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Break Ritual Contract/Oath/Bond      | -2   | Formal, witnessed agreements. Bond breaking also costs Void etc. |
| Ritual Failure due to Negligence     | -1   | If lack of preparation/respect caused failure (GM call).     |

| Betray Declared True Will            | -3   | Also costs Void.                                             |
| Actions Contradicting Faction Tenets | -1-2 | e.g., Nexus commodifying ritual, ACG forgiving debt without cause. |

Soulcredit is often tracked passively by factions like the Sovereign Nexus and  ACG. It can affect access, pricing, legal standing, and ritual  permissions.

## 8. Bonds, Kinship & True Will (Detailed)

These systems form the core of character identity and relationships in Aeonisk.

### 8.1. Bonds

*“To act is to bind. To bind is to become.”* Bonds are formal metaphysical contracts, witnessed and recorded, forming the stable units of identity.

**Mechanics Recap:**

- Max 3 (Freeborn: 1).
- Formed via in-game ritual/oath.
- +2 Rituals together.
- +1 Soak defending Bonded.
- Sacrifice: +5 to Willpower roll (once/session), +1 Void, +1 Soul Debt, -1 Emp (scene).

**Bond Types (Examples):**

| Type       | Description                                                  | Common Consequences                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kinship    | Ancestral, chosen, or ritualized family.                     | Inheritance, duty, shared Soulcredit pool, ritual access.    |
| Ascendancy | Subordination to a higher Will (mentor, House, Faction).     | Amplified power/access via patron, loss of autonomy.         |
| Debt       | Owed spiritual/material obligation. Often ACG brokered.      | Soulcredit drain, ritual marking, compelled service.         |
| Voidward   | Alignment with nullity, taboo forces, often Tempest-related. | Isolation, power spikes, unpredictable Void effects, hunted. |
| Passion    | Intense emotional/creative entanglement (lovers, artistic rivals). | Unstable resonance, feedback loops, potent shared rituals.   |
| Faction    | Formal allegiance to an institution (Nexus, Pantheon, etc.). | Legal protection/obligation, behavioral constraints, access. |

**Bond Status:** Active / Dormant (strained, no bonuses) / Severed / Void-Locked (inactive due to high Void).

### 8.2. Kinship

*“Blood is an echo. Kinship is the structure we build to hear it.”* Kinship is ritual architecture, maintained through oaths, memory, and Faction/Ring matrices. Not purely genetic.

**Kinship Structures:**

- **Bloodline Houses:** Biological descent, use Fleshcrafting. Often Nexus-aligned.
- **Mnemonic Families:** Shared memory defines lineage (ancestral echoes). Common in Aether Dynamics.
- **Ritual Pods:** Temporary kin-groups formed/dissolved via rites/astral timing.
- **Sovereign Families:** Nexus dynasties with indexed Soulcredit trees; corporate-states.
- **Fracture Kin:** Forbidden forms (exiles, Void-touched). Often Freeborn or Tempest.

**Responsibilities of Kin:** Share Soulcredit effects, enact ancestral rites, shelter from Void, intercede in dreamspace, maintain archives.

### 8.3. Bonding Rites

Must be witnessed (people, ancestors, AI, gods). The rite itself is often key.

- **Spiral Vow:** Binds souls to shared purpose around glyph. Often permanent.
- **Red Thread Tether:** Wound through flesh/symbol for kin-duty. Severed only via major ritual.
- **Voidcall Sealing:** Bonds with null forces. High cost, rarely reversible (Tempest).
- **Debtbinding:** ACG-sanctioned ritual marking debtor's resonance. Requires spiritual restitution.

### 8.4. True Will

Your soul's sacred trajectory. A metaphysical path, not a simple goal.

**Mechanics Recap:**

- Starts undefined. Declared during play.
- **Alignment:** +1 to all Willpower-based rolls.
- **Betrayal:** +3 Void, narrative crisis.

**Discovering True Will:** Can happen through visions, extreme stress, moments of clarity,  fulfilling a deep need, or guidance from mentors/entities. It should  feel like a revelation, not just picking a cool motto. It often aligns  with or conflicts with Factional dogma or Bond obligations, creating  story tension.

## 9. Technology & Equipment

Aeonisk tech is ritually encoded, interacting with Will, Bond, Void, and Soulcredit.

### 9.1. Core Principle: Will Drives Technology

Technology is spiritually active. No tool is truly neutral.

- **True Will Resonance:** Tech aligned with your True Will performs better (precision, reduced Void gain). Using tech *against* your Will causes glitches, increased Void.
- **Soulcredit Gating:** High-end or restricted tech (military gear, advanced drones) may  require Soulcredit authentication. Low SC can cause jams, alarms,  lockouts. High SC may unlock features or reduce Void cost.
- **Ritual-Tethered Systems:** Complex tech (AI, sentry grids) may require active ritual interfacing,  Bonded pilots, attunement, or even offerings to function.
- **Void Interference:** At Void ≥ 5, tech can glitch, jam, hallucinate targets, invert function, or become possessed/corrupted.

### 9.2. Weapon Classes

| Type              | Description                                       | Effect                                                       | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bonded**        | Ritually attuned to one person.                   | +1 Atk / +2 Def for Bonded user. -2 penalty if used by others (maybe bleed). | Requires ritual, offering. Common personal items.            |
| **Glyph-Encoded** | Inscribed with sacred/functional sigils.          | Bypass specific wards/protections. May have elemental effects. | Needs ritual maintenance or degrades (+1 Void risk on use if degraded). |
| **Void-Infused**  | Forbidden tech touched by the Hollow.             | +4 Damage, ignores *ritual* defenses. **Always +1 Void on use.** | Fumble: Backlash, entity summons, psychic feedback. Tempest favored. |
| **Spirit-Weave**  | Rare, organic/alchemical, embedded spirit.        | Adapts to intent. +1 bonus if used aligned with True Will.   | May give warnings (dreams, whispers). Aether/Freeborn craft. |
| **Contractual**   | Digitally/ritually locked via ACG/Nexus contract. | Functions only if Soulcredit/contract valid.                 | Breach: Shutdown, explosion, ritual debt, alerts authorities. |

**Example Techno-Weapons:**

| Name                | Type            | Size | Effect                                   | Special                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Mnemonic Blade      | Bonded melee    | 3    | +2 Damage if emotionally invoked         | +1 Void if used against Bonded without cause     |
| Shrike Cannon       | Glyph rifle     | 6    | Ignores *basic* ritual armor             | Must be ritually recoded monthly                 |
| Ash Pulse Pike      | Void polearm    | 5    | +4 Damage, stuns astral entities         | +2 Void on critical hit                          |
| Compact Drone Halo  | Assistant drone | 2    | Creates barrier (Soak +5 vs ranged)      | Costs 1 Spark per hour, requires Soulcredit ≥ -2 |
| Debtbreaker Sidearm | Contract pistol | 2    | Won't fire without valid contract/SC ≥ 0 | Fires astral tag rounds (trackable by ACG)       |

### 9.3. Aeonisk Currency System (Detailed)

*“You don’t trade money. You transfer charged energy.”*

**Core Principles:** No abstract currency. Value is stored/transferred elemental energy via  talismans. Talismans hold units of charge (e.g., Spark Core 1000/1000).  Spending siphons energy to recipient/ritual, not the item. Empty  talismans can be recharged or sacrificed.

**The Six Currency Types:**

| Talisman   | Element | Meaning                         | Common Uses                                      |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grain**  | Earth   | Stability, structure, grounding | Trade goods, housing, crafting, tools, defense   |
| **Drip**   | Water   | Emotion, secrecy, flow, healing | Travel, information, healing, smuggling, secrets |
| **Spark**  | Fire    | Action, force, urgency, will    | Combat, powering tech, rituals, enchantments     |
| **Breath** | Air     | Thought, communication, change  | Messaging, performance, insight, social rituals  |
| **Hollow** | Void    | Corruption, erasure, nullity    | **Forbidden.** Black markets, Void rituals       |
| **Seed**   | None    | Raw potential, unaligned will   | **Untradeable.** Must be ritually attuned        |

**Talisman Sizes & Capacity:**

| Size   | Capacity Range | Physical Form               |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Single | 1 unit         | Coin, shard, pebble         |
| Band   | 10–99          | Ring, bracelet, bar         |
| Sigil  | 100–999        | Medallion, etched disk      |
| Core   | 1,000–9,999    | Orb, crystal, capacitor     |
| Vault  | 10,000+        | Sealed relic, ritual device |

**Hollows & Seeds:**

- **Hollows:** Using increases Void Score (+1 or more). Illegal in Nexus space. Traded by Tempest. Can corrupt other talismans nearby.
- **Seeds:** Represent unfulfilled Will, cleansed Void, or potent sacrifice. Cannot  be bought/sold. Attuning requires a ritual, vow, and suitable offering,  transforming it into a standard (Grain, Drip, etc.) or unique talisman.  Failure to attune can create a dangerous "Hollow Echo".

**Soulcredit Interaction:** Some high-value trades or access to certain markets/services require a  minimum Soulcredit score. Spending currency unethically (bribery,  coercion) can lower Soulcredit.

**Faction Preferences:** Factions favor currencies aligned with their philosophy (e.g., Nexus:  Grain/Breath; ACG: All (as broker); Tempest: Hollow/Spark; Aether:  Drip/Breath).

## 10. Factions & Culture

Power aligns with philosophy, not geography.

*(See Appendix 1 for full Faction details, including Tenets and Mechanical Notes)*

- **Sovereign Nexus:** Theocratic matriarchy. Order, ritual, hierarchy. Regulates magick, cleanses Void.
- **Astral Commerce Group (ACG):** Financial entity. Tracks/brokers Soulcredit, contracts, ritual debt. Law is literal.
- **Pantheon Security:** Privatized tactical force. Loyalty, procedure. Militarized ritual, Void containment.
- **Aether Dynamics:** Ecological-spiritual balance. Leylines, harmony, symbiosis. Fluid ritual, attuned tech.
- **Arcane Genetics:** Biotech/ritual fusion. Evolution, coded spirituality. Fleshcrafting, programmable purity.
- **Tempest Industries:** Subversive syndicate. Stolen tech, forbidden ritual, Void tools. Power through control.
- **Freeborn / Unbound:** Outside faction structure. Rare, mistrusted/feared. Scarce Bonds, truth over power.

## 11. World Lore

### 11.1. History Synopsis

Aeonisk's dominant species evolved from bonobo ancestors, retaining some emphasis on intimacy but developing complex, matriarchal societies. They  harnessed technology, underwent an Age of Enlightenment, and eventually  unified under the matriarch Aurora (~1500 years ago) who formed the **Sovereign Nexus** to ensure peace through centralized authority and technological/astral  advancement. Interstellar travel led to colonization (Arcadia, Elysium,  Nimbus). The Nexus maintains stability but faces whispers of dissent and hidden agendas.

### 11.2. The Aeons

Metaphysical currents shaping reality, not just time periods.

- **Aeon of Osiris (First Sovereignty, ~6000-1200 BR):** Age of Towers. Defined Will through form, structure, pattern, naming.  Key Tech: Celestial harmonics, ritual metalwork, codified lineage.  Events: Treaty of Ten Provinces, Project of Names, Harmonium War. *Outsiders:* Siblings of the Black Horizon (embraced Void).
- **Aeon of Isis (Aeon of Weaving, ~1200 BR - 0 BR):** Root Aeon. Focused on connection, continuity, intuition, remembrance.  Matriarchal, recursive. Law was sung. Key Tech: Fleshcrafting, astral  convergence, memory-weaving. Structure: Covenant Rings (Kinship, Dream,  Descent). Events: Rites of Recovery, Founding of Rings, Subduction Wars, Spiral Reconciliation.
- **Aeon of Horus (Sovereign Aeon, 0 AR - Present ~683 AR):** Present Aeon. Awakening of individual sovereignty, codified  consequence, metaphysical economy (Soulcredit). Will as Law, Choice as  Sacrament, Debt as Reflection. Key Tech: Soulcredit economy, ritual AI  arbitration, biotech under oath, astral infrastructure. *Periods:* Early (Nexus rises, SC quantified), Middle (Fracture Cults, Ritual  Standardization Act, Eye of Breach AI), Late (Bond status key, Void  Accord Crisis, prophecy returns).

### 11.3. Liturgical Calendar (Abbreviated)

- **High Rites:** Equinoxes/Solstices (Breath, Flame, Grain, Drip) - Public rituals.
- **Feasts of Passage:** Life (birth/naming), Fire (male puberty), Water (female puberty), Death.
- **Civic Festivals:** Ledger Day (ACG), Bondlight (Nexus), Ash Resonance (Aether), Maskfire (Pantheon/Freeborn), Seedmoon (Wild).

*(See Appendix 3 for full Calendar details).*

### 11.4. Daily Life & Culture

Life is stratified by Faction and Soulcredit. Ritual is part of  infrastructure (leyline regulators). Currency is tangible energy. Bonds  strain and mend. Void is a present danger. Celebrations range from  sanctioned Ritual Raves to underground Void Parties and domestic  Bond-Nights. Intoxicants are elemental and symbolic (Breathwine, Spark  Dust, Dripmist, Void Nectar). Kinship is ritualized, not just genetic.

## 12. GM Toolkit

### 12.1. Ritual Fallout Table (d6)

Roll when Cost Roll fails, offering skipped, or Void ≥ 5.

1. **Backlash:** 1d6 Fatigue or +1 Void (caster's choice).
2. **Sigil Fracture:** Primary Ritual Item cracks (-bonuses until restored).
3. **Emotional Echo:** Someone nearby relives an unrelated memory/emotion.
4. **Entity Attention:** A minor spirit/entity takes notice. Future complication.
5. **Bond Pulse:** Nearby Bonds tested (Empathy vs 16). Failure = strain.
6. **Inversion:** Ritual outcome is opposite of intent (heal harms, ward invites).

### 12.2. Void Intrusion Table (d6)

Invoke spontaneously at Void ≥ 6 during stress/ritual.

1. **Whispers:** Offers deal, speaks True Will, sows doubt.
2. **Oath Erosion:** Must roll Willpower vs 18 to maintain belief in a key Bond.
3. **Reversal of Purpose:** Must justify current action aligning with True Will or gain +1 Void.
4. **Astral Bleed:** Invisible symbols appear on skin; destabilizes nearby rituals (1 scene).
5. **False Reflection:** See self/others as monstrous/distorted for a moment.
6. **The Eye Opens:** GM dictates 1 action reflecting deepest fear/Void temptation.

### 12.3. Contract Hooks & Debt Encounters

- **Hooks:** Lost Ledger (SC archive), Echo Clause (ghostly Bond), Debt Transfer (new holder demands favor).
- **Encounters:** The Auditor (ACG agent), The Bonebird (Nexus tracker), The Void Broker (Tempest offers debt-binding).

### 12.4. Bond Conflict Mechanics

- **Triggers:** Acting against Bond, Void ≥ 7, secret sacrifice, ritual failure.
