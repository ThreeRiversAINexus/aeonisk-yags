# Aeonisk - YAGS Module

*“Will is Power. Bond is Law. Void is Real.”*

Version 1.1.1-pre

## 1. Introduction

Aeonisk is a science-fantasy roleplaying setting built on intimacy, intention, and control, using the **Yet Another Game System (YAGS)** as its foundation. In this world, there are no nations — only factions, dynasties, and spiritual economies. Technology hums in harmony with  magick. Rituals shape reality. Bonds bind more than blood.

You are a wielder of Will. You live in a world where to act is to mean  something — and to mean something is dangerous. This module adapts the  YAGS system into a framework for stories about:

- Sacred trust and betrayal
- Power bought with spirit, not coin
- The slow erosion of self under the weight of debt, duty, or the Void

You may rise through purpose, or fall through sacrifice. But either way: the Astral is watching.

### 1.1. What Kind of Game is Aeonisk?

Aeonisk YAGS focuses on:

- Emotional and spiritual tension, not just physical conflict.
- Ritual magick with consequences, cost, and deep symbolism.
- Formally declared Bonds as party cohesion and narrative anchors.
- A real spiritual economy of Soulcredit and ritual debt.
- The creeping influence of the Void as temptation and corruption.

It is ideal for:

- GMs who love story-first design with consequence-driven mechanics.
- Players who want their character’s choices to echo in the Astral.
- Groups comfortable with intimacy, ideology, and irreversible sacrifice.

### 1.2. The Core Trinity of Aeonisk

- **Will:** Your purpose — not your desire, but your alignment with the world’s  hidden pattern. Following it empowers you. Betraying it breaks you.
- **Bond:** A sacred, formal connection. Emotional, spiritual, sometimes political — but never casual. Bonds are the true structure of parties, not classes.
- **Void:** The result of power without connection. Isolation made manifest. The  astral price of intention unanchored to empathy or sacrifice.

### 1.3. YAGS System Integration

Aeonisk uses the core YAGS mechanics but modifies or adds the following:

| System Element        | Aeonisk YAGS Modification                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core Dice Mechanic    | Skill Attribute × Skill + d20                                |
| Ritual Resolution     | Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 vs Ritual Threshold. Outcome determined by margin of success/failure. |
| New Skills            | Astral Arts, Magick Theory, Intimacy Ritual, Corporate Influence, Debt Law (examples) |
| Void Score            | Tracks spiritual corruption (0–10); passively warps reality at 5+, triggers Void Spike on rapid gain. |
| Soulcredit            | Tracks spiritual trust and obligation (–10 to +10).          |
| Bond Mechanics        | Formal connections (max 3, Freeborn 1). Provides +2 to rituals and +1 Soak (defending Bonded). Can be sacrificed. |
| Ritual Tools          | Requires a Primary Ritual Item (non-consumable) and a sacrificial Offering  (consumed). No offering = +1 Void, potential outcome downgrade. |
| Tech/Enchantments     | Require significant offerings, narrative weight, and carry Void risk or spiritual cost. May interact with Soulcredit/Will. |
| Initiative (Optional) | Agility × 4 + d20                                            |

## 2. Core YAGS Mechanics

YAGS uses a relatively simple set of core rules.

### 2.1. Terminology

- **Attribute:** One of the eight basic numbers defining a creature. Typical human average is 3.
- **Skill:** Defines training and experience in a narrow field. Combined with Attributes for task resolution. Professional level is 4+.
- **Ability:** Attribute × Skill (for Skill Checks) or Attribute × 4 (for pure Attribute Checks).
- **Die:** A single twenty-sided die (d20).
- **Difficulty:** The target number for a task. Ability + d20 must meet or exceed the Difficulty. Moderate tasks are Difficulty 20.
- **Task:** An activity requiring an Ability check (Attribute × Skill + d20 or Attribute × 4 + d20).
- **Score:** The raw numerical value of a characteristic.

### 2.2. Task Resolution

The core mechanic for almost all actions:

Ability + d20 vs Difficulty

- **Skill Check:** Attribute × Skill + d20 vs Difficulty
- **Attribute Check:** Attribute × 4 + d20 vs Difficulty

**Difficulties (YAGS Standard):**

| Type           | Target | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Very easy      | 10     | Minimal skill needed. Professionals always succeed.          |
| Easy           | 15     | Small amount of skill needed. Difficult for untrained.       |
| Moderate       | 20     | Achievable by professionals in ideal conditions. Difficult without. |
| Challenging    | 25     | Requires professional skill. Out of league for basic familiarity. |
| Difficult      | 30     | Requires high skill. Even professionals hard pressed.        |
| Very difficult | 40     | Master level required. Highest difficulty in normal circumstances. |
| Extreme        | 50     | Very difficult task under poor conditions.                   |
| Heroic         | 60     | Truly heroic.                                                |
| Sheer folly    | 75     | Requires superhuman skill.                                   |
| Absurd         | 100    | Beyond most capabilities.                                    |

*(Aeonisk typically uses a narrower range of 15-20 for standard Skill Checks, but Rituals have their own specific thresholds. GMs can use the YAGS  standard for non-ritual tasks).*

**Fumbles & Criticals:**

- A natural '1' on the d20 is an automatic failure (fumble).
- A natural '20' on the d20 in a Skill Contest automatically wins if your skill score is higher than the opponent's.

**Degrees of Success:**
If how well you succeed matters:

- **Moderate Success:** Meet the Difficulty.
- **Good Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 10+. (Task performed with style, completeness, or speed).
- **Excellent Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 20+. (Performed with two of style/completeness/speed).
- **Superb Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 30+. (Performed with style, completeness, *and* speed).
- **Fantastic Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 40+.
- **Amazing Success:** Exceed Difficulty by 50+. (Close to perfection).

**Skill Contests:**
Instead of a fixed Difficulty, two or more characters roll their relevant Ability + d20.

- Highest roll wins.
- On a tie, the character with the higher Skill *score* wins.
- A natural '20' wins automatically if your Skill score is higher.

**Skilled Professionals (Skill 4+):**
Professionals have extra options for predictable, non-opposed tasks:

- **Assume '0':** For predictable tasks, assume a d20 roll of '0'. Negates fumble chance but requires the task to be well within capability.
- **Assume '10':** For non-stressful tasks where you can take time, assume a d20 roll of '10'. Removes fumble risk but takes twice as long.
  *(GM decides if a task is predictable/stressful. If fumble chance > 1, these options cannot be taken).*

### 2.3. Attributes

Eight primary attributes define raw potential. Human average is 3, range typically 2-5 (higher is rare).

- **Strength (Str):** Physical power, lifting, hurting, breaking things. Carrying capacity is based on Str^2.
- **Health (Hea):** Endurance, fitness, resisting injury/poison/fatigue, staying conscious.
- **Agility (Agi):** Quickness, acrobatics, balance, dodging, brawling.
- **Dexterity (Dex):** Hand-eye coordination, sleight-of-hand, melee/pistol skills, driving.
- **Perception (Per):** Alertness, senses (vision, hearing), observation, noticing things. Used for rifles/bows.
- **Intelligence (Int):** Wit, cunning, memory, intuition, logic, knowledge skills.
- **Empathy (Emp):** Understanding others, manipulation, reaction, charisma base.
- **Willpower (Wil):** Mental fortitude, resisting fear/magic/temptation, concentration, lying. Key for Aeonisk Rituals.

**Attribute Levels (Human Norm):**

| Score | Level       | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | None        | No rateable ability. Cannot attempt skills using it.         |
| 1     | Crippled    | Severely impaired (very dumb, ill, socially inept).          |
| 2     | Poor        | Noticeably below average (bottom 10%). Minimum possible for most. |
| 3     | Average     | Middle 80% of the population.                                |
| 4     | High        | Noticeably above average (top 10%).                          |
| 5     | Very High   | Highly adept naturally. Highest natural level without training. |
| 6     | Exceptional | Truly exceptional, trained hard. Hard to compete against.    |
| 7     | Incredible  | One of a small number in the country.                        |
| 8     | Legendary   | Normal human maximum. Handful of people in the modern world. |
| 9+    | Superhuman  | Beyond natural possibility.                                  |

**Secondary Attributes:**

- **Size:** Defaults to 5 for adult humans (range 4-6). Governs soak capacity and wound levels. Logarithmic scale (see YAGS rules).
- **Move:** Determines speed. Equal to Size + Strength + Agility + 1. (Typical human: 5+3+3+1 = 12). Combat move = Move / 2 (rounded down).
- **Soak:** Base resistance to damage. Defaults to 12 for adult humans. Modified by armour.

### 2.4. Skills

Skills represent training and experience. Most default to 0 unless learned.

**Skill Levels:**

| Level | Description           | Notes                                                        |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Casual                | Basic familiarity (single lesson, brief exposure).           |
| 2-3   | Student               | Studied in school or reasonable practice. Succeeds at easy tasks. |
| 4-7   | Professional          | Competent professional (4-5). Seasoned veteran (6-7). Can buy Techniques. |
| 8-11  | Master                | True understanding, years of dedicated study. Elite level.   |
| 12-15 | Legendary             | Highest level found in most worlds. Leaders in their field.  |
| 16+   | Mythical / Superhuman | Province of superheroes or supernatural beings.              |

**Types of Skills (YAGS Standard):**

- **Talents:** 8 core skills known to some extent by all humans (start at 2).  Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile, Sleight, Stealth, Throw.
- **Knowledges:** Theoretical knowledge, must be learned (Skill 1+). Cannot be used untrained.
- **Languages:** Rated 1-4+ for fluency. Not typically rolled.
- **Standard Skills:** Mix of knowledge, experience, aptitude. Can be used untrained, but roll (straight d20) is halved, fumble on 1 or 2.

**Skill Defaults:**
Some skills can default to others (often a Talent). When using a default:

- Final result (Attribute × Skill + d20) is halved.
- Fumble chance is doubled (or minimum 2 if it was 1).
- Cannot use Techniques.

**Skill Pre-requisites:**
Some skills require others at a certain level before they can be learned.

- Must meet all pre-requisites before buying Skill level 1.
- A skill can never be more than double the level of any of its pre-requisites.

**Techniques:**
Specialisations bought with experience points, allowing bonuses or special actions.

- Require a minimum skill level equal to their cost.
- May have prerequisite techniques.
- **Familiarities:** Required for skills covering diverse equipment (e.g., Drive). Cost 2-4 points. Using without familiarity halves roll.
- **Specialisations:** Focus knowledge (e.g., History [English Civil War]). Makes specific tasks easier.
- **Masteries:** Levelled specialisations (cost 1 per level) for competitive/artistic  skills. Grant +1 bonus per level. Opponents with lower mastery suffer +1 fumble chance per level difference.

## 3. Aeonisk Core Mechanics

Aeonisk builds upon YAGS, adding unique systems for rituals, spiritual standing, and personal destiny.

### 3.1. Rituals

Rituals are acts of intention, symbolism, and sacrifice, not simple spells. They channel Will through the Astral.

- **Ritual Roll:** Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 [+2 if Bonded participant assists] vs Ritual Threshold.
- **Outcome:** Success or failure, and the consequences, are determined by the margin  against the Ritual Threshold (see Section 6). No second roll is needed.

**Ritual Thresholds:**

| Type      | Ritual Threshold | Description                                                |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minor     | 16               | Emotional veil, symbolic marking, light defense            |
| Standard  | 18               | Bond reinforcement, magickal tracking, simple bindings     |
| Major     | 20–22            | Contract severing, astral healing, memory reweaving        |
| Forbidden | 26–28            | Soul extraction, resurrection, Void channeling (High Void) |

**Requirements:**

- **Primary Ritual Item:** A non-consumable item, sacred to the caster. Required for meaningful rituals. If lost: –2 to Ritual Rolls.
- **Offering:** A consumable item or concept (emotion, memory, blood, object)  symbolically appropriate to the ritual's intent. Burned, buried, bled,  spoken, etc.
  - **Skipping Offering:** Gain +1 Void. May shift the ritual outcome downward by one tier on the  outcome table (see Section 6). Unethical intent also triggers Void  penalty.

*(See Section 6 for detailed Ritual Rules).*

### 3.2. Soulcredit & Void

These track spiritual alignment and trustworthiness.

- **Soulcredit (SC):** –10 to +10. Represents spiritual trust and standing.
  - *Gain:* Fulfill contracts, aid rituals, cleanse Void.
  - *Lose:* Break Bonds/contracts, ritual without offering, betray True Will.
  - *Effects:* Influences faction relations, access to tech/rituals. (+6 to +10 = Trusted; –6 to –10 = Hunted/Cut Off).
- **Void Score (VS):** 0 to 10. Represents spiritual corruption and disconnection.
  - *Gain:* Skip offerings, unethical rituals, break True Will, use Void-forged items.
  - *Effects:*
    - **Void Spike:** Gaining 2+ Void from a single event stuns the character (see Section 7.1).
    - **Void ≥ 5:** Passively alters the environment, causing narrative instability (see Section 7.1).
    - **Void ≥ 7:** Bonds become Dormant; sacred spaces reject you.
    - **Void = 10:** Claimed by the Void (potential loss of agency).
  - *Cleanse:* Ritual at ley site, restore Bond, sacrifice something irreplaceable.

*(See Section 7 for detailed Void & Soulcredit Rules).*

### 3.3. Bonds

Formal, mutual metaphysical connections based on ritual or oath. The backbone of relationships and party structure.

- **Limit:** Max 3 Bonds (Freeborn origin: 1).
- **Benefits:**
  - +2 to Ritual Rolls when performing together.
  - +1 Soak when defending a Bonded partner.
- **Sacrifice a Bond (Sever):** Once per session, gain +5 to *any* Willpower-based roll.
  - *Cost:* +1 Void, +1 Soul Debt (to the severed person), –1 Empathy for the scene. A major narrative and spiritual act.

*(See Section 8 for detailed Bond Rules).*

### 3.4. True Will

Your soul’s sacred trajectory or purpose. Not a motto, but a metaphysical path.

- **Declaration:** Starts undefined. Declared mid-play through insight, ritual, or character growth.
- **Alignment:** Acting *in* alignment grants +1 to *all* Willpower-based rolls.
- **Betrayal:** Acting *against* declared True Will incurs +3 Void and triggers a narrative/spiritual  crisis (GM discretion). Additionally, if performing a ritual that  contradicts declared True Will, the margin result is worsened by one  tier (see Section 6).

*(See Section 8 for more on True Will).*

### 3.5. Aeonisk Currency: Elemental Economy

Aeonisk uses charged elemental talismans instead of abstract money. Value is transferred energy.

- **Types:** Grain (Earth), Drip (Water), Spark (Fire), Breath (Air). Each represents different conceptual energies.
- **Forbidden:** Hollow (Void) - Black market, corrupting.
- **Potential:** Seed (Unaligned) - Cannot be traded, must be attuned through ritual/sacrifice.
- **Usage:** Energy is siphoned from talismans (e.g., Spark Core 743/1000) to pay  others or power devices. Empty talismans can be recharged or sacrificed.
- **Sizes:** Single (1 unit), Band (10-99), Sigil (100-999), Core (1k-9.9k), Vault (10k+).

*(See Section 9 for detailed Currency Rules).*

## 4. Character Creation

Create an Aeonisk character using YAGS principles, modified by the setting's unique elements.

### 4.1. Step 1: Concept & Priority

Decide on your character concept. The GM sets the starting power level  (Mundane, Skilled, Exceptional, Heroic - see YAGS Characters PDF), which determines points pools. Prioritize the three point pools (Attributes,  Experience, Advantages) into Primary, Secondary, Tertiary based on your  concept.

### 4.2. Step 2: Choose Origin (Faction/Background)

Select an Origin. This grants an Attribute bonus (+1 to one of two listed stats) and a special trait.

| Origin                | Attribute Bonus (+1)    | Trait                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sovereign Nexus       | Willpower or Int        | **Indoctrinated:** +2 to resist ritual disruption or mental influence. |
| Astral Commerce Group | Intelligence or Emp     | **Contract-Bound:** Start with +1 Soulcredit or one favourable minor contract/debt owed *to* you. |
| Pantheon Security     | Strength or Agility     | **Tactical Protocol:** Once per combat, automatically succeed on an Initiative roll (treat as 20). |
| Aether Dynamics       | Empathy or Perception   | **Ley Sense:** Can sense the presence, general strength, and mood (calm/turbulent) of nearby ley lines. |
| Arcane Genetics       | Health or Dexterity     | **Bio-Stabilized:** +2 to rolls resisting biological Void effects, disease, or mutation. |
| Tempest Industries    | Dexterity or Perception | **Disruptor:** +2 bonus when attempting to sabotage or hijack rituals or ritually-encoded tech. |
| Freeborn / Unbound    | Any 3 Attributes        | **Wild Will:** Can only form/maintain 1 Bond. Cannot sacrifice this Bond without extreme cost (GM call). |

### 4.3. Step 3: Assign Attributes

Distribute points into the 8 primary YAGS attributes (Str, Hea, Agi, Dex, Per,  Int, Emp, Wil) according to your chosen priority level and point pool.  Remember the human average is 3. Apply your +1 Origin bonus *after* spending points. Check maximum attribute level allowed by campaign level.

### 4.4. Step 4: Choose Skills

Spend Experience points on Skills. Select from the YAGS core list or  Aeonisk-specific skills. All characters start with the 8 Talents  (Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile, Sleight, Stealth, Throw) at  level 2 for free. Check maximum skill level allowed by campaign level.

**Aeonisk Skills:**

| Skill               | Attribute | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Astral Arts         | Willpower | Channeling, resisting, and shaping spiritual energies in rituals. |
| Magick Theory       | Int       | Knowledge of glyphs, ritual systems, sacred mechanics, Aeons. |
| Intimacy Ritual     | Empathy   | Performing emotionally-powered or Bond-based rituals. Requires trust. |
| Corporate Influence | Emp       | Navigating faction politics, extracting favors, reading intentions. |
| Debt Law            | Int       | Understanding/manipulating contracts, oaths, Soulcredit systems. |

### 4.5. Step 5: Define True Will (Later)

Leave your True Will undefined for now. It will emerge and be declared during play.

### 4.6. Step 6: Form Bonds (Optional)

You start with no Bonds unless determined otherwise by the GM or through  spending Advantage points (if allowed). Bonds are formed in-game through ritual or oath. Max 3 (Freeborn: 1).

### 4.7. Step 7: Gather Ritual Kit & Equipment

- **Primary Ritual Item (1):** Define a personal, sacred item. Narratively important, mechanical effect if lost (-2 Rituals).
- **Offerings (1-3):** Define 1-3 starting consumable offerings appropriate to your character concept.
- **Starting Currency:** GM determines starting elemental currency based on TL and background  (e.g., equivalent to YAGS starting cash, converted to elemental  talismans).
- **Other Gear:** Basic clothing, tools of trade are assumed. Spend remaining starting  funds or use Advantage points for significant items (weapons, armour,  tech).

### 4.8. Step 8: Calculate Secondary Attributes & Final Checks

- **Size:** Default 5 (human).
- **Move:** Size + Str + Agi + 1.
- **Soak:** Base 12 (human). Add armour bonuses.
- **Void Score:** Starts at 0.
- **Soulcredit:** Starts at 0.
- **Wound/Stun/Fatigue Levels:** Based on Size (Humans typically have 5 levels before Fatal/Out/Exhausted).

## 5. Combat Rules (Optional System)

Combat uses the YAGS core loop, potentially modified by Aeonisk elements. GMs may opt for more narrative resolution.

### 5.1. Combat Round (~5 seconds)

1. **Roll Initiative:** (Once per combat)
   Initiative = Agility × 4 + d20

   - High roll acts earlier.
   - Fumble (natural 1): Initiative becomes 0. All rolls halved for the round, actions are Slow.

2. **Declare Actions:** (In *increasing* initiative order - lowest goes first)

   - State intended action (attack, move, defend, wait, ritual, etc.).
   - Declare number of defences (Max = Average of Agility & Perception, round up; typically 3 for humans).

3. **Resolve Actions:** (In *decreasing* initiative order - highest goes first)

   - **Fast Actions:** Resolve first. (e.g., Quick Shot, some manoeuvres).
   - **Normal Actions:** Resolve next. (e.g., Standard Attack, Move + Attack).
   - **Slow Actions:** Resolve last. (e.g., Sprint + Attack, Aimed Shot, most Rituals).

4. **Make Attacks:**

   - **Attack Roll:** Attribute × Skill + Weapon Bonus + d20
     *(Attribute/Skill depends on weapon: e.g., Dex × Melee, Per × Guns, Agi × Brawl)*
   - **Defense Roll:** Attribute × Skill + Weapon Defense + d20
     *(Usually same Attribute/Skill as attack type being defended against)*
   - **Hit:** If Attack Roll ≥ Defense Roll. (If not defending, Attack Roll vs base Difficulty 15).

5. **Inflict Damage:**

   - **Damage Roll:** Strength × 1 + Weapon Damage + d20
   - **Soak:** Target's base Soak + Armour bonus.
   - **Effect:** If Damage Roll ≥ Soak, deal Wounds or Stuns. 1 level per 5 points damage exceeds Soak.

6. **Track Wounds/Stuns:**

   | Wounds | Stuns | Penalty | Description                     |
   | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
   | 1      | 1-2   | -       | Minor (Bruised)                 |
   | 2      | 3     | -5      | Light (Lightly Wounded/Stunned) |
   | 3      | 4     | -10     | Moderate (Wounded/Stunned)      |
   | 4      | 5     | -15     | Heavy (Seriously Wounded/Dazed) |
   | 5      | 6+    | -25     | Critical (Critical/Beaten)      |
   | 6+     | -     | -40     | Fatal (Health check or die)     |

   - Wounds track lasting injury. Stuns track temporary impact/bruising. Penalties stack!
   - *Damage Types:* Wound (swords, bullets), Stun (fists, clubs), Mixed (knives; half wounds, half stuns).

7. **End of Round:**

   - Make Health checks to stay conscious if Critical/Fatal/Beaten.
   - Apply ongoing effects (bleeding, poison, rituals, Void).
   - Start next round (Declare Actions).

### 5.2. Aeonisk Combat Considerations

- **Void Spike:** Gaining 2+ Void at once can stun a character, causing them to lose their next turn.
- **Void:** High Void score (5+) causes environmental disruption (see Sec 7.1) that can lead to narrative complications, fumbles, misfires, or tech  glitches at GM discretion.
- **Bonds:** Gain +1 Soak when actively defending a Bonded partner from an attack targeting them.
- **Technology:** Weapon properties (Glyph, Void, Contractual) apply. Tech may malfunction due to Void environmental effects or low Soulcredit.
- **Rituals in Combat:** Usually Slow actions. Require concentration (Focused stance - no  defense). Interrupting a ritual can cause backlash based on the Margin  Outcome table (typically a Failed result).

## 6. Ritual System (Detailed)

Power flows through sacrifice. Without offering, there is only Void. Rituals  alter emotion, memory, contracts, spiritual structure, or reality.

### 6.1. Performing a Ritual

1. **State Intent:** Clearly define the ritual's purpose (e.g., "Reinforce my Bond with Wren," "Cleanse this area of Void residue").

2. **Gather Components:**

   - **Primary Ritual Item:** Must be held/present. Personal, sacred. Loss incurs -2 penalty to Ritual rolls.
   - **Offering:** Consumed during the ritual. Must be symbolically relevant. Skipping  incurs +1 Void and potentially worsens the outcome (see Step 5).

3. **Roll Ritual:** Willpower × Astral Arts + d20 [+2 if Bonded participant assists]

4. **Check Success:** Compare result to the Ritual Threshold.

   | Type      | Ritual Threshold |
   | --------- | ---------------- |
   | Minor     | 16               |
   | Standard  | 18               |
   | Major     | 20–22            |
   | Forbidden | 26–28            |

5. **Determine Outcome by Margin:** Ritual Outcome is now determined solely by the margin of success or  failure against the Ritual Threshold. No second roll is needed.

   **Margin of Success vs Ritual Threshold:**

   | Margin       | Result               | Consequence                                 |
   | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | –10 or worse | Catastrophic fumble  | +2 Void, backlash, GM invokes Fallout       |
   | –5 to –9     | Failed + backlash    | +1 Void, Bond strain, minor spiritual bleed |
   | –1 to –4     | Failed (no effect)   | Emotional fatigue or confusion (GM choice)  |
   | 0 to +4      | Weak success         | Side effects, reduced duration or clarity   |
   | +5 to +9     | Solid success        | No backlash, full effect if offering used   |
   | +10 to +14   | Strong resonance     | Gain minor benefit (e.g., +1 SC, insight)   |
   | +15+         | Echo or breakthrough | Exceptional results, story-altering power   |

   > Offerings remain essential. Skipping adds +1 Void and may shift result downward by one tier.
   > If performing a ritual that contradicts declared True Will, the margin result is worsened by one tier.

6. **Adjudicate Outcome:** GM describes the effects based on the result from the Margin Outcome  Table, the ritual's intent, the offering (or lack thereof), and the  narrative context.

### 6.2. Ritual Outcome Consequences

The Margin Outcome Table (Section 6.1, Step 5) covers the spectrum of results:

- **Catastrophic Fumble (Margin –10 or worse):** Severe negative consequences, high Void gain, and potential narrative Fallout invoked by the GM.
- **Failure with Backlash (Margin –5 to –9):** The ritual fails and causes tangible negative effects like Void gain, spiritual harm, or strained Bonds.
- **Simple Failure (Margin –1 to –4):** The ritual simply doesn't work, potentially causing minor mental or emotional effects.
- **Success Tiers (Margin 0+):** The ritual works to varying degrees of effectiveness, potentially with  side effects at lower margins or beneficial bonuses at higher margins.

### 6.3. Group Rituals

- Requires mutual Bonds among participants.
- Lead caster makes the Ritual Roll (gains Bond Bonus if applicable). This  single roll determines the outcome for the group based on the margin  table.
- Each participant must provide their *own* Offering. If *any* participant skips their offering, the group incurs the standard  penalties (+1 Void for the group, potential downgrade of the result  tier).
- Consequences from the outcome table (Void gain, backlash, benefits) generally apply  to all participants, unless the GM rules otherwise based on narrative  context (e.g., a specific backlash targeting the lead caster).

### 6.4. Void and Rituals

- **Void ≥ 5:** The passive environmental disruption (see Section 7.1) caused by high  Void can interfere with rituals. GM may apply narrative penalties,  increase the risk of unstable outcomes (potentially shifting the result  down a tier on the Margin table), or introduce complications related to  the ambient Void effects.
- **Void ≥ 7:** Cannot participate in group rituals (Bonds are Dormant). Own rituals  are significantly more prone to unstable results (GM likely shifts  results down one or even two tiers on failure, or introduces severe side effects even on success).
- **Void Gain from Rituals:** Gaining 2+ Void from a single ritual (e.g., Catastrophic Fumble or  Failure+Backlash combined with skipping an offering) triggers a **Void Spike** (see Section 7.1).

## 7. Void & Soulcredit System (Detailed)

*“Every act is a signature. Every signature leaves a mark.”*

### 7.1. Void Score (0-10)

Measures spiritual corruption, disconnection, and proximity to being Claimed.

**Effects by Score:**

| Score   | State         | Passive Effects / Narrative Tone                             | Specific Mechanics                                           |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-2     | Clear         | Grounded, fully functional.                                  | None.                                                        |
| 3-4     | Disturbed     | Dreams distort, rituals may feel slightly off, unease near sacredness. | Minor narrative fluctuations at GM discretion.               |
| **5-6** | **Afflicted** | **Void Environmental Disruption:** Static in air, dream fragments leak, ritual color changes. Ambient instability. | GM applies narrative pressure, minor tech glitches, uneasy feelings in others. *No roll required.* Character feels like "walking corruption." |
| **7-8** | **Severed**   | **Void Environmental Disruption:** Leylines flicker, tech flickers erratically, Bonds shift to Dormant. Increased isolation. | Significant narrative instability. Bonds provide no mechanical benefits. Difficulty forming new connections. |
| **9**   | **Hollowed**  | **Void Environmental Disruption:** Sacred spaces reject you (passive harm/warding), even passive rituals misfire or twist. | Cannot benefit from sacred sites. Rituals highly prone to negative outcomes  (GM applies penalties/tier shifts). Active spiritual repulsion. |
| **10**  | **Claimed**   | **Void Environmental Disruption:** Reality warps visibly around you. **Claimed.** | The Void acts through the character. Potential loss of agency (GM may seize narrative control). |

**Void Spike (New Rule):**
If a character gains **2 or more Void** from a single event (e.g., catastrophic ritual failure + skipping offering), they are **stunned**:

- **Combat:** Lose next turn.
- **Narrative:** Dazed, confused, vulnerable to spiritual intrusion or manipulation.

**Gaining Void:**

| Action                        | Void +   | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ritual without Offering       | +1       | Per ritual. May also worsen outcome margin.                  |
| Unethical Ritual/Intent       | +1/+2    | Per ritual, GM discretion based on severity.                 |
| Break True Will               | +3       | Per significant betrayal. Triggers narrative crisis & worsens relevant ritual margins. |
| Sacrifice a Bond for Power    | +1       | Per sacrifice.                                               |
| Use Void-Forged Item/Weapon   | +1-2     | Per significant use (e.g., combat scene, major activation).  |
| Channel/Bind Void Entity      | +2 to +5 | Based on entity power and ritual success/failure.            |
| Perform Forbidden/Void Ritual | Varies   | Based on ritual description and margin outcome. Often +2 to +4 on failure/backlash. |
| Break Sacred Oath/Contract    | +1-3     | Depending on solemnity and consequences.                     |
| Fail Ritual (Margin -5/-10)   | +1 / +2  | As per Margin Outcome Table.                                 |

**Cleansing Void:** Requires sacrifice or reconciliation.

| Method                                         | Void –   | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cleansing Ritual at Ley Site                   | -1       | Requires significant offering, successful Ritual roll (Solid Success margin or better). |
| Restore a Broken Bond (Genuine Reconciliation) | -1       | Requires RP, possibly ritual. Both parties must agree.       |
| Complete Quest Aligned with True Will          | -1 to -2 | Must involve significant personal cost/sacrifice. GM call.   |
| Destroy Item Tied to Corruption                | -1       | Item must be significant source/symbol of Void gain. GM call. |
| Sacrifice Something Irreplaceable              | -3       | Truly significant: relic, core memory, power, relationship feature. One time. |

### 7.2. Soulcredit (SC) (–10 to +10)

Measures spiritual reputation, integrity, and trustworthiness within the  metaphysical economy. (Rules remain unchanged from v1.1.0, reiterated  here for clarity).

**Effects by Score (Optional Social Rules):**

| Score     | Status                 | Social/Factional Effects                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| +6 to +10 | Ritually Exalted       | Trusted by sacred factions (Nexus), access to high-tier rituals/tech. Leaders. |
| +1 to +5  | Clean / Reliable       | Generally accepted, standard access.                         |
| 0         | Neutral / Unknown      | Default starting state. No strong opinions either way.       |
| -1 to -5  | Flagged / Unreliable   | Watched by auditors (ACG), limited access, social suspicion. |
| -6 to -9  | Rejected / Debt-Marked | Excluded from sacred spaces/rituals, hunted by debt collectors, pariah status. |
| -10       | Spiritually Bankrupt   | Considered astrally toxic, null. May be targeted for cleansing/containment. |

**Gaining Soulcredit:**

| Action                               | SC + | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fulfill Ritual Contract/Oath         | +1   | Formal, witnessed agreements.                                |
| Aid Another's Ritual (with Offering) | +1   | Must contribute meaningfully (energy, offering).             |
| Public Ritual (aligned w/ Bond/Will) | +2   | Must be witnessed, significant, and successful (Solid+ margin). |
| Cleanse Void Site/Person             | +2-3 | Based on severity of Void and risk involved.                 |
| Uphold Faction Tenets (at cost)      | +1   | e.g., Nexus upholding doctrine, ACG enforcing Debt Law fairly. |
| Ritual Success (Strong Resonance+)   | +1   | As per Margin Outcome Table benefit.                         |

**Losing Soulcredit:**

| Action                               | SC – | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Break Ritual Contract/Oath/Bond      | -2   | Formal, witnessed agreements. Bond breaking also costs Void etc. |
| Ritual Failure due to Negligence     | -1   | If lack of preparation/respect caused failure (GM call).     |
| Refuse/Default on Ritual Debt        | -2   | Especially if formally logged by ACG.                        |
| Betray Declared True Will            | -3   | Also costs Void.                                             |
| Actions Contradicting Faction Tenets | -1-2 | e.g., Nexus commodifying ritual, ACG forgiving debt without cause. |

Soulcredit is often tracked passively by factions like the Sovereign Nexus and  ACG. It can affect access, pricing, legal standing, and ritual  permissions.

## 8. Bonds, Kinship & True Will (Detailed)

These systems form the core of character identity and relationships in Aeonisk.

### 8.1. Bonds

*“To act is to bind. To bind is to become.”* Bonds are formal metaphysical contracts, witnessed and recorded, forming the stable units of identity.

**Mechanics Recap:**

- Max 3 (Freeborn: 1).
- Formed via in-game ritual/oath.
- +2 Rituals together.
- +1 Soak defending Bonded.
- Sacrifice: +5 to Willpower roll (once/session), +1 Void, +1 Soul Debt, -1 Emp (scene).
- **Void ≥ 7:** Bonds become Dormant (provide no mechanical benefits).

**Bond Types (Examples):** (Unchanged from v1.1.0)

| Type       | Description                                                  | Common Consequences                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kinship    | Ancestral, chosen, or ritualized family.                     | Inheritance, duty, shared Soulcredit pool, ritual access.    |
| Ascendancy | Subordination to a higher Will (mentor, House, Faction).     | Amplified power/access via patron, loss of autonomy.         |
| Debt       | Owed spiritual/material obligation. Often ACG brokered.      | Soulcredit drain, ritual marking, compelled service.         |
| Voidward   | Alignment with nullity, taboo forces, often Tempest-related. | Isolation, power spikes, unpredictable Void effects, hunted. |
| Passion    | Intense emotional/creative entanglement (lovers, artistic rivals). | Unstable resonance, feedback loops, potent shared rituals.   |
| Faction    | Formal allegiance to an institution (Nexus, Pantheon, etc.). | Legal protection/obligation, behavioral constraints, access. |

**Bond Status:** Active / Dormant (strained or high Void, no bonuses) / Severed / Void-Locked (Void = 10, potentially corrupted).

### 8.2. Kinship

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)
*“Blood is an echo. Kinship is the structure we build to hear it.”* Kinship is ritual architecture, maintained through oaths, memory, and Faction/Ring matrices. Not purely genetic.

**Kinship Structures:** (Examples) Bloodline Houses, Mnemonic Families, Ritual Pods, Sovereign Families, Fracture Kin.
**Responsibilities of Kin:** Share Soulcredit effects, enact ancestral rites, shelter from Void, intercede in dreamspace, maintain archives.

### 8.3. Bonding Rites

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)
Must be witnessed. The rite itself is often key. Examples: Spiral Vow, Red Thread Tether, Voidcall Sealing, Debtbinding.

### 8.4. True Will

Your soul's sacred trajectory. A metaphysical path, not a simple goal.

**Mechanics Recap:**

- Starts undefined. Declared during play.
- **Alignment:** Acting *in* alignment grants +1 to *all* Willpower-based rolls.
- **Betrayal:** Acting *against* declared True Will incurs +3 Void and triggers a narrative/spiritual crisis (GM discretion).
  - 
  - **Ritual Conflict:** Performing a ritual that *directly contradicts* your declared True Will worsens the margin result by one tier (e.g., a  "Solid Success" becomes a "Weak Success", a "Failed + Backlash" becomes  "Catastrophic Fumble"). This is in addition to the Void gain.

**Discovering True Will:** (Unchanged from v1.1.0) Can happen through visions, extreme stress,  moments of clarity, fulfilling a deep need, or guidance from  mentors/entities. It should feel like a revelation. It often aligns with or conflicts with Factional dogma or Bond obligations, creating story  tension.

## 9. Technology & Equipment

Aeonisk tech is ritually encoded, interacting with Will, Bond, Void, and Soulcredit.

### 9.1. Core Principle: Will Drives Technology

(Unchanged from v1.1.0, but Void Interference reflects new rules)

- **True Will Resonance:** Tech aligned with True Will performs better. Using tech *against* True Will causes glitches, increased Void risk.
- **Soulcredit Gating:** High-end tech may require SC authentication. Low SC can cause jams, lockouts. High SC may unlock features.
- **Ritual-Tethered Systems:** Complex tech may require ritual interfacing, Bonded pilots, offerings.
- **Void Interference:** At Void ≥ 5, the **Void Environmental Disruption** (Sec 7.1) can cause tech to glitch, jam, hallucinate targets, invert  function, or become susceptible to spiritual corruption/possession based on the severity of the Void score and narrative context.

### 9.2. Weapon Classes

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)
Bonded, Glyph-Encoded, Void-Infused (+1 Void on use), Spirit-Weave, Contractual.

**Example Techno-Weapons:** (Unchanged from v1.1.0)
Mnemonic Blade, Shrike Cannon, Ash Pulse Pike (+2 Void on crit), Compact Drone Halo, Debtbreaker Sidearm.

### 9.3. Aeonisk Currency System (Detailed)

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)
*“You don’t trade money. You transfer charged energy.”*

**Core Principles:** Value stored/transferred elemental energy via talismans (Grain, Drip,  Spark, Breath, forbidden Hollow, potential Seed). Talismans hold units  of charge. Spending siphons energy. Empty talismans recharged or  sacrificed.

**The Six Currency Types:** (Meanings and Uses Unchanged)
**Talisman Sizes & Capacity:** (Unchanged) Single, Band, Sigil, Core, Vault.
**Hollows & Seeds:** (Unchanged) Hollows increase Void, Seeds untradeable until attuned via ritual.
**Soulcredit Interaction:** (Unchanged) Affects market access, ethical spending impacts SC.
**Faction Preferences:** (Unchanged)

## 10. Factions & Culture

(Section remains conceptually unchanged from v1.1.0, pointing to Appendix 1)
Power aligns with philosophy, not geography. See Appendix 1 for details on  Sovereign Nexus, ACG, Pantheon Security, Aether Dynamics, Arcane  Genetics, Tempest Industries, and the Freeborn/Unbound.

## 11. World Lore

(Section remains conceptually unchanged from v1.1.0)
Includes History Synopsis (Aeons of Osiris, Isis, Horus), Liturgical Calendar, Daily Life & Culture notes.

## 12. GM Toolkit

### 12.1. Ritual Fallout and Void Intrusion

**[REPLACES Void Tables from v1.1.0]**

Instead of rolling on d6 tables, **Ritual Fallout** and **Void Intrusion** are now narrative effects triggered by specific conditions. GMs should  use these as tools to inject complications, consequences, and the  tangible effects of spiritual instability.

**Triggers for Ritual Fallout / Void Intrusion:**

- **Ritual Failure (Margin –5 or worse):** The consequence listed on the Margin Outcome table often *is* the Fallout (e.g., backlash, Bond strain, +Void). GMs can elaborate on  this narratively. For Catastrophic Fumbles (Margin -10 or worse), the GM should invoke a significant, story-altering Fallout event.
- **Skipping Offering:** Besides the +1 Void and potential tier downgrade, the GM might  introduce a minor Fallout effect reflecting the imbalance (e.g.,  attracting minor negative entities, the ritual having a subtle, unwanted twist).
- **Crossing Void Thresholds (especially ≥ 5) in a Dramatic Moment:** When a character's Void score increases to 5 or higher during a tense  scene (combat, negotiation, stealth), the GM can introduce an immediate  narrative effect reflecting the **Void Environmental Disruption** (see Section 7.1). This isn't necessarily a punishment, but a reflection of the character's state warping reality. Examples:
  - (Void 5-6): Nearby lights flicker, whispers echo just out of hearing, a bonded item feels cold.
  - (Void 7-8): A nearby Bonded ally feels a wave of doubt, crucial tech momentarily jams, leyline energy visibly distorts.
  - (Void 9): A protective ward flares painfully against the character, their own shadow seems to lag or distort, passive sensory rituals give false  readings.
- **Void Spike Triggered:** The stun effect is primary, but the GM can add narrative flavour –  disorientation, flashes of disturbing imagery, a moment of vulnerability to spiritual influence.
- **GM Discretion based on Story Context:** High Void characters are walking sources of instability. In moments of  high stress, emotional turmoil, or when interacting with powerful  spiritual forces, the GM can introduce narrative intrusions reflecting  the character's corruption. Examples: tempting whispers from the Void,  brief hallucinations, objects reacting strangely to their presence,  allies feeling unnerved.

**Focus on Narrative:** The goal is to make high Void *feel* dangerous and unstable, influencing the story and environment directly, rather than relying solely on random table results. The GM should  tailor the intrusion or fallout to the specific character, their current situation, and their Void score.

### 12.2. Contract Hooks & Debt Encounters

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)

- **Hooks:** Lost Ledger, Echo Clause, Debt Transfer.
- **Encounters:** The Auditor, The Bonebird, The Void Broker.

### 12.3. Bond Conflict Mechanics

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)

- **Triggers:** Acting against Bond, Void ≥ 7, secret sacrifice, ritual failure backlash.
- **Resolution:** Prompt RP scene. Unresolved = Bond becomes Dormant.

### 12.4. Mission Generator (Roll 1d6 Twice)

(Unchanged from v1.1.0)

| d6   | Goal                                                         | d6   | Twist                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Sever a cursed/Voided Bond                                   | 1    | Target is Bonded to a PC                                  |
| 2    | Recover a stolen Primary Ritual Item                         | 2    | Ritual must occur during dangerous ley pulse/storm        |
| 3    | Enforce/Break a spiritually binding contract (ACG/Nexus)     | 3    | Rival Faction interferes with contradictory goals         |
| 4    | Cleanse a Void-corrupted ley site/person                     | 4    | Void entity offers aid... for a price                     |
| 5    | Smuggle a Void-afflicted oracle/relic out of Faction control | 5    | The sacred site/relic is sentient and resists             |
| 6    | Protect/Guide someone whose True Will is awakening           | 6    | Success directly conflicts with a PC's declared True Will |

## Appendix 3: Glossary of Aeonic Terminology

- **Abyss:** The existential gulf between the formed self and ultimate Will.
- **Aeon:** Metaphysical current shaping reality. Not time, but awakening.
- **AR/BR:** After/Before Reconciliation (Year 0). Standard time notation.
- **Bond:** Formal metaphysical alignment/contract. Real and binding.
- **Codex Nexum:** Governing legal-mnemonic text of the Nexus.
- **Covenant Rings:** Isis Aeon structure (Kinship, Dream, Descent).
- **Eye of Breach:** Unsanctioned AI that mirrors the Codex Nexum. Active on Nimbus and Hollow Vector.
- **Hollow:** An emptied shell—Bond or Seed drained of intent, now unstable energy.
- **Fleshcrafting:** Ritual-biological art of reshaping form via lineage/memory.
- **Freeborn:** Person outside of factions, unbound.
- **Ritual Consequence:** All action generates metaphysical reaction. Outcome now determined by margin of success/failure.
- **Soulcredit:** Spiritual economy of Horus Aeon. Tracks debt/merit. Real/enforced.
- **Sovereign Nexus:** Dominant Horus Aeon technocratic/spiritual infrastructure.
- **True Will:** Soul's sacred trajectory. Alignment empowers, betrayal corrupts (+3 Void, worsens conflicting ritual margins).
- **Veil:** Membrane between mundane reality and the Astral. Crossing = projection, scrying, trance.
- **Void:** A tracked score (0–10) reflecting spiritual disconnection. Now  passively warps reality around you at 5+. Gaining 2+ Void at once causes a Void Spike.
- **Void Spike:** A stun/daze condition triggered when 2+ Void is gained from a single  event. Causes loss of next turn (combat) or vulnerability (narrative).
