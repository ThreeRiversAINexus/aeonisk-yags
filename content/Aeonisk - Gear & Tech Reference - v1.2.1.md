# Aeonisk Gear & Tech Reference

*Quick‑look tables for weapons, armor, accessories, vehicles, and companion automata — all formatted for at‑table play or fast GM prep.*

------

## 0 · Economics & Infrastructure

**Raw Seed** – Unstable; degrades in 7 cycles (7 weeks); +1 Void if used without proper ritual attunement. Becomes a Hollow when degrading. Must be ritually attuned into an elemental aspect before use in specialized gear or as a stable talisman.  
*May be preserved in an Echo-Calibrator or fully attuned at a Ritual Altar to mitigate Void risk.*

**Echo-Calibrator** – Used to help stabilize and align Raw Seeds during attunement rituals. Requires careful handling (DC 16 Dexterity + Craft/Tech check to avoid +1 instability). Standard upkeep: 1 Drip charge per 3 uses.

**Ritual Altar** – A prepared sacred space or dedicated device that focuses energies for attunement rituals. Provides +1 to +3 bonus on attunement ritual rolls depending on quality and offerings; risk of instability if desecrated or improperly maintained (GM discretion). Upkeep: offerings or cleansing rites.

---

> **GM Tip—Local Rates:** Typical markets peg 1 Spark ≈ 2–5 Drips per session; high-security hubs (e.g., Aeonisk Prime) slide it closer to 1 Spark = 3 Drips, while frontier bazaars might only honor 1 Spark = 2 Drips.

## 2 · Weapon Catalog (Field Stats)

**How to read this table:**  
• "Key Numbers" are flat bonuses (e.g. "+5 DMG") you add to the normal
  YAGS damage roll (Str × Skill + d20).  
• A dash (—) means "same as a baseline weapon of this type"; *Scales*
  means damage grows with your current Void score.  
• Items marked *‡* have GM-set scaling; items marked *★* are vehicle-mounted.  
• Abbreviations: SC = Soulcredit, DMG = damage bonus, DEF = defence bonus,
  Void = Void impact.  
See the foot-notes beneath the table and the Reference Symbols list for full details.
