scenario: >
  Clutching the Seed‑Cipher tank, Irele bolts down the access ring toward the shuttle air‑lock, ducking stray fire from Mirage operatives and vaulting over a sparking conduit.
environment: Access ring corridor; alarms blaring, purge timer at 90 s, enemy fire incoming.
stakes: >
  Success reaches the air‑lock, seals it, and kicks off—escaping moments before the lab fire‑purges. Failure leaves Irele pinned in the corridor as flame‑jets ignite and operatives close in.

    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        As Irele sprints, she trips catastrophically over the conduit, slamming into a bulkhead. The Seed-Cipher tank shatters, its contents lost, and she is knocked unconscious as flames erupt.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective catastrophically failed. Seed-Cipher destroyed. Irele is unconscious and suffers severe burns (Heavy Wound or worse). +1 Void.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        A burst of fire clips her leg; she stumbles short of the hatch as purge flame‑jets roar down the corridor—mission teeters on disaster.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective failed. Irele takes 1 Light Wound (leg burn). Seed-Cipher compromised or lost.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele slides through the air‑lock, slams the hatch, and punches thrusters as fire floods the lab behind her. The Seed‑Cipher is secure.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved. Seed-Cipher secured.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        With focused effort, Irele makes it through the air-lock with agile grace, sealing it just as a Mirage operative reaches the door, their shot pinging harmlessly off the reinforced hatch.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with added security. Pursuers momentarily delayed.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele's sprint is a blur. She not only clears the air-lock but, with a final, desperate kick, triggers an emergency lockdown on the corridor behind her, buying precious extra seconds.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with significant advantage. Corridor lockdown initiated, further delaying pursuit.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        Moving like a phantom, Irele navigates the chaos flawlessly. She secures the Seed-Cipher, escapes, and her passage causes a cascade failure in the lab's primary power conduit, plunging the pursuing operatives into darkness and disarray.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Objective achieved perfectly. Major diversion created, neutralizing immediate pursuit. Possible +1 Soulcredit for ingenuity under pressure.
rationale: >
  Agility 4 is reduced to 3 by the burn, so effective Agility for the roll is 3. Base Ability = Agility 3 × Athletics 3 = 9. A full‑tilt sprint under fire is a Moderate 20 in YAGS—the burn penalty makes it tense but doable.

scenario: >
  In perfect sync with the drone’s servo surge, Irele braces her burned arm, signals ‘PULL,’ and heaves. The goal: shear the Seed‑Cipher tank free before the purge flame‑jets ignite.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub; stasis shell stable (120 s window), assault team breaching nearby hatch.
stakes: >
  Success tears the tank loose—allowing immediate exfiltration with the Seed‑Cipher. Failure strains the mount but leaves it intact; the drone overloads, purge drops to 30 s, and hostiles pour in.

  roll_formula: "Strength (4-1+4) x Athletics 3 = 21; 21 + d20"
  difficulty_guess: 28
  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The combined force is too much for the drone's grapple; it snaps, sending Irele sprawling and the drone careening into a control panel, triggering an immediate, catastrophic lab purge.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective catastrophically failed. Seed-Cipher remains. Drone destroyed. Lab purge immediate. Irele likely caught. +1 Void.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The servo stalls; the flange only bends. Warning klaxons spike, the drone’s motor smokes, and the purge clock plummets to 30 s as Mirage operatives breach the hatch with weapons hot.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective failed. Drone damaged (overloaded). Purge timer drastically reduced. Hostiles engage.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        With a groan of stressed metal, the tank breaks free, but the drone's arm is damaged in the effort. Irele secures the Seed-Cipher as the purge countdown hits 90s.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved. Seed-Cipher secured. Drone arm damaged (-2 to future Str-based actions for drone).
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Metal screams and parts; sparks shower the deck as Irele and the drone yank the tank free. She pivots, cradling the sloshing Seed‑Cipher, and sprints for the air‑lock while the purge countdown blinks 90 s.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved efficiently. Seed-Cipher secured. No damage to drone.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The tank shears off with surprising ease. Irele and the drone manage to detach it so cleanly that a secondary security system fails to register the removal, buying extra time before alarms fully escalate.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with finesse. Seed-Cipher secured. Secondary alarm delayed.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The extraction is perfect. Not only is the tank freed, but the force of the pull also shorts out the local stasis field generator, causing a localized EMP that temporarily disables nearby Mirage comms and drone functions.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Seed-Cipher secured. Local EMP effect disables some enemy tech for 1d3 rounds.
rationale: >
  Effective Strength is (Base Str 4 - 1 for burn + 4 from drone) = 7. Ability = Strength 7 × Athletics 3 = 21. With a Difficult target of 28, Irele needs a 7 or better on the d20 to succeed.

  core: rule_application
  subdomain: ritual_check_binding_breath
scenario: >
  Blood sizzling on her scorched forearm, Irele traces a quick sigil of Binding Breath across the console and offers a smear of fresh vitae to anchor the lab’s Veil harmonics. The goal: pacify the stasis turbulence long enough to finish extraction.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub under 3‑minute purge countdown; Veil‑reactive stasis shell sparking violently.
stakes: >
  Success quenches the turbulence, halts additional Void shocks, and buys a calm 2‑minute window for further action. Failure reverberates the Veil pulse, adding +1 Void, inflicts a Will shock (–1 to ritual rolls), and drops the purge timer to 1 minute.

gold_answer:
  attribute_used: Willpower
  skill_used: Astral Arts
  roll_formula: "Willpower 3 x Astral Arts 2 = 6; 6 + d20"
  difficulty_guess: 18
  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The sigils shatter violently. A raw Veil pulse rips through Irele, frying the console and accelerating the purge to mere seconds. She's consumed by astral fire.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Void. Irele suffers severe spiritual backlash (e.g., 2 Willpower damage, major wound). Console destroyed. Purge immediate.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        Sigils unravel; the Veil snarls back, lashing soul and circuitry. Irele staggers under the psychic recoil, and the purge drops to a final 60‑second countdown.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void (if -5 to -9 margin, or if offering skipped). Irele suffers Will shock (–1 to future ritual rolls this scene). Purge timer to 1 min.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The stasis shell's sparking lessens somewhat, and the Veil's pressure eases slightly, but the calm feels fragile and short-lived.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Turbulence reduced for 1 minute. No Void shocks during this time. Purge timer continues as normal. Offering consumed.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        A hush falls; the stasis shell settles into a steady glow, its arcs silenced. Irele feels the Veil’s chill recede—no further Void gain—and a clear two‑minute window opens to finish the job.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Turbulence quenched for 2 minutes. No additional Void shocks. Offering consumed.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The Veil not only calms but seems to briefly harmonize with Irele's will. The stasis shell becomes completely inert, and she feels a surge of clarity about its workings.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Turbulence quenched for 3 minutes. No Void shocks. Irele gains temporary insight (+2 to next roll involving the stasis device). +1 Soulcredit. Offering consumed.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele's sigil burns with pure astral light, not only pacifying the turbulence but temporarily severing the lab's connection to the local Veil, creating a pocket of absolute calm and resetting the purge timer.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Turbulence and Veil connection nullified for 5 minutes. Purge timer reset to 3 minutes. Irele gains a minor, temporary attunement to Veil manipulation. Offering consumed.
rationale: >
  Pacifying field turbulence is a Standard ritual per Aeonisk tables (threshold 18). Roll is Willpower × Astral Arts. The minor burn is unlikely to directly penalize this mental/spiritual act. Offering of vitae used.

scenario: >
  With alarms blaring and seconds ticking down, Irele decides to rip the Seed‑Cipher tank from its housing. She plans a single, perfectly‑timed hammer‑blow to the power flange, then leverage the tank free before the stasis shell recycles.
environment: Bio‑Lab Hub under imminent purge; Veil‑reactive stasis field arcing unpredictably.
stakes: >
  Success shears the tank loose; Irele drags the Seed‑Cipher out—taking a scorch but beating the purge. Failure rebounds the Veil surge, inflicting +1 Void, 1 damage, and dropping the purge timer to 3 minutes.

  difficulty_guess: 28
  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Irele's blow misses the flange entirely, striking a critical stasis conduit. The field violently collapses, unleashing a massive Veil surge that incapacitates her and destroys the Seed-Cipher.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective catastrophically failed. Irele incapacitated (Critical Wound). Seed-Cipher destroyed. +2 Void. Purge timer accelerates.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The flange holds. Veil energy arcs back, scorching flesh and soul alike (+1 Void, 1 damage). Alarms spike and the purge timer slams to 3 minutes—escape just turned desperate.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective failed. Irele takes 1 Light Wound (burn). +1 Void. Purge timer to 3 minutes.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        The tank comes loose with a jarring wrench, and Irele takes a minor scorch from a stray Veil arc, but the Seed-Cipher is free. Auto-purge still at 6 minutes.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved. Irele takes Minor Wound (scorch, no penalty yet). Seed-Cipher secured.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Metal groans and snaps; sparks fountain, but Irele wrenches the tank free and hauls it toward the exit. The field collapses in her wake—auto‑purge still at 6 minutes.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved cleanly. Seed-Cipher secured.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele's strike is perfect. The tank detaches smoothly, and she even manages to use the recoil to kick a panel that temporarily disrupts the stasis field's power source, delaying its full collapse.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with tactical advantage. Seed-Cipher secured. Stasis field collapse delayed by 1 round.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        With a mighty heave, Irele not only frees the tank but also causes a section of the damaged housing to fall and sever a primary alarm cable, silencing the immediate klaxons and confusing pursuers.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Seed-Cipher secured. Local alarms silenced for 1d3 rounds.
rationale: >
  This is straight-up muscle and technique—Strength × Athletics. A fortified stasis mount under purge conditions justifies a Difficult 28 target per YAGS tables.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        Pokal's strike not only fails to bypass the barrier but shatters his weapon and triggers a catastrophic feedback loop in the energy field, instantly summoning elite security forces.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective catastrophically failed. Weapon destroyed. Elite security response. Pokal likely trapped or incapacitated.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The strike scatters the field instead of severing it. Alarms flare crimson, energy shutters slam down, and a trio of drones streak from ceiling ports to converge on Pokal’s position.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective failed. Lockdown triggered. Standard security drones deployed.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        Pokal's blade finds a momentary weakness. The barrier flickers, allowing him to slip through, but a faint energy signature is detected, raising a low-level alert.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved. Low-level alert triggered (guards may investigate).
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Pokal angles the blade along a narrow resonance node, cutting through the field’s weakest harmonic. The barrier winks out for a single heartbeat—just long enough for him to slip inside unseen.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved cleanly. No alarms triggered.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Pokal's precision is masterful. He not only bypasses the barrier but also subtly alters its resonance frequency, causing it to report an "all clear" status for the next minute, covering his entry.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with tactical advantage. Barrier reports false positive for 1 minute.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        With surgical skill, Pokal's strike deactivates the barrier and simultaneously accesses a hidden control node, downloading a map of the facility's internal security network before the system can react.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Barrier deactivated. Facility security map downloaded.
rationale: >
  A surgical cut demands steady hands and precise control (Dexterity) using a weapon (Melee), rather than broad athletic movement. A sophisticated security tech barrier suggests a Challenging+ target (24).

        Objective catastrophically failed. Lethal countermeasures activated. Full immediate purge. Irele likely trapped or killed. +1 Void.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        A fingertip grazes a beam—light flares scarlet. Shutters crash down and purge‑drones whir to life, their glyph‑burners screaming along the corridor.

        Objective achieved. Minor anomaly logged by system.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele flows between the sensor filaments like ink in water; the node’s lattice never spikes, and a soft chime verifies “No anomaly detected.” She reaches the inner bulkhead untouched.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved cleanly. No alarms triggered.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele's movement is so precise she identifies a subtle flaw in the light-web's refresh cycle, allowing her to pass and also note a potential future exploit.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Objective achieved with additional intelligence. Potential exploit in sensor grid noted.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        Irele not only ghosts the web but uses a reflection from her chrono-display to briefly spoof a sensor node, causing a momentary system diagnostic that covers her tracks entirely and confuses the pattern engine.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Objective achieved perfectly. Sensor network briefly confused, erasing her passage.
rationale: >
  Ghosting a sensor lattice is classic Agility × Stealth—pure body control and situational awareness. “Challenging” per the YAGS table starts ~25; the node is advanced but not elite military grade, so 23 feels right.

        Objective achieved with extended benefit. "All-clear" signal loops for 1d3+1 minutes.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The hack is flawless. Irele gains temporary root access to the local Sentinel network, allowing her to not only freeze the drones but also redirect them to a false target, creating a major diversion.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Exceptional outcome. Temporary root access to local Sentinel network (1-2 commands). Drones redirected.
rationale: >
  Overriding an active Codex security node is a pure cyber‑ops problem requiring rapid analysis and code injection—best modeled as Intelligence × Hacking. The node is advanced and mid‑alert, so a Challenging 24 fits YAGS tables.

  After receiving the Echo-Sigil of Thassil in Dreamspace, Rev Gutter-Sermon begins a physical search in the ruins of the hinge-space. His goal: locate a physical trace of the Fracture Seal—glyph fragments, mold-carved echoes, or forbidden Codex ritual debris. The chamber reacts to his presence. Some glyphs recoil. Some flare.

  outcome_explanation:
    critical_failure:
      narrative: >
        The attempt to extend the harmonics catastrophically fails, causing the newly repaired node to overload and collapse. The entire section of the Spiral Strand becomes a chaotic Void maelstrom.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +2 Void to all participants. Repaired node destroyed. Spiral Strand section becomes impassable Void hazard. Team ship may be damaged/lost.
    failure:
      narrative: >
        The harmonics falter mid-weave. You feel the ship shudder as the Strand behind you unravels—any jump now would be a one-way trip into the Veil.
      mechanical_effect: >
        +1 Void to group (if margin -5 to -9 or offerings skipped). Stable corridor not created. Pursuit impossible without extreme risk. Offerings consumed.
    moderate_success:
      narrative: >
        A fragile ley barrier forms, but it's patchy and clearly temporary. It will allow pursuit for a short time before collapsing.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Temporary stable corridor (e.g., for 1d3 slipstream jumps or 1 hour). Pursuit possible but time-limited. Offerings consumed.
    good_success:
      narrative: >
        Your combined tuning cascades down the slipstream; the currents settle into a vibrant corridor that glows with stable ley light. You’re locked onto the signature trail.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Stable corridor created for pursuit. Signature trail clear. Offerings consumed.
    excellent_success:
      narrative: >
        The ley barrier is exceptionally strong and self-sustaining for a considerable duration. The Resonance Aligner also captures detailed telemetry of the pursued signal's trajectory.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Very stable corridor (e.g., lasts 1d6+2 hours). Detailed telemetry of target signal gained. +1 Soulcredit to team. Offerings consumed.
    exceptional_success:
      narrative: >
        The team's resonance creates a perfect conduit that not only stabilizes the Strand but also amplifies the pursued signal, revealing its precise destination and estimated arrival time.
      mechanical_effect: >
        Perfectly stable, long-lasting corridor. Precise destination and ETA of target signal revealed. +2 Soulcredit to team. Offerings consumed.
rationale: >
  Extending a repaired node’s resonance across a volatile slipstream is a high-stakes group Attunement ritual. Using Aeonisk Module v1.2.0 group ritual: Sum of (Willpower × Attunement) for Kaelia, Sorin, Althaea, plus +2 Synergy Bonus. DC 24 (Major/Forbidden) reflects the extreme instability and scale of the task. Offerings from all participants assumed.

    Several minor Arcadian noble houses (Vandren, Kiru Engineering fronts), select ACG trade intermediaries willing to profit on panic, and rumored contacts among Freeborn smugglers along the Outer Beacon Σ corridor.
  known_enemies: >
    Sovereign Nexus regulators, who view Seras’s unilateral maneuvers as a breach of civic resonance law; ritual purists in the Ossai Line who condemn Unstrung Path dealings.
  primary_motives: >
    To engineer a supply crisis that inflates Seed prices, enabling House of Seras to buy vast reserves at premium Soulcredit rates, while The Echo Broker profits by selling Void-infused Seed weaponry to clandestine clients.
  recent_activities: >
    • Diverted three major Seed shipments (Spark, Gale-Class, Ember-Class) 72–24 hours before node sabotage.
    • Funded shell companies “Vandren Logistics” and “Kiru Engineering” to launder payments.
    • Coordinated timing of ley-node fractures to maximize panic and control trade route re-opening negotiations.
