# Archive

This directory holds optional reference material and conversion outputs that are not part of the active Aeonisk toolchain.

* Place any legacy Markdown rulebooks that you want to convert under `archive/rulebooks/`.
* Conversion targets such as PDFs, EPUBs, or normalized markdown will be written to `archive/releases/` and `archive/converted_yagsbook/`.

The active dataset tooling continues to live under `datasets/` and the Python/TypeScript sources remain unchanged. Keeping archival material here keeps the repository lightweight while preserving a spot for historical resources when needed.
